Here we found that the mutation of FRMD7, a gene that is defective in human congenital nystagmus, leads to the selective loss of the horizontal optokinetic reflex in mice, as it does in humans. This is accompanied by the selective loss of horizontal direction selectivity in retinal ganglion cells and the transition from asymmetric to symmetric inhibitory input to horizontal direction-selective ganglion cells. In wild-type retinas, we found FRMD7 specifically expressed in starburst amacrine cells, the interneuron type that provides asymmetric inhibition to direction-selective retinal ganglion cells. This work identifies FRMD7 as a key regulator in establishing a neuronal circuit asymmetry, and it suggests the involvement of a specific inhibitory neuron type in the pathophysiology of a neurological disease.']",Congenital Nystagmus Gene FRMD7 Is Necessary for Establishing a Neuronal Circuit Asymmetry for Direction Selectivity.,19,Botond Roska,Keisuke Yonehara,"[Keisuke Yonehara, Michele Fiscella, Antonia Drinnenberg, Federico Esposti, Stuart Trenholm, Jacek Krol, Felix Franke, Brigitte Gross Scherf, Akos Kusnyerik, Jan Müller, Arnold Szabo, Josephine Jüttner, Francisco Cordoba, Ashrithpal Police Reddy, János Németh, Zoltán Zsolt Nagy, Francis Munier, Andreas Hierlemann, Botond Roska]","[Neural Circuit Laboratories, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Maulbeerstrasse 66, 4058 Basel, Switzerland, Bio Engineering Laboratory, Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering of ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, 4058 Basel, Switzerland, Neural Circuit Laboratories, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Maulbeerstrasse 66, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; University of Basel, Petersplatz 1, 4003 Basel, Switzerland, Department of Ophthalmology, Semmelweis University, Mária u, 39, 1085 Budapest, Hungary, Department of Human Morphology and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Tűzoltó u, 58, 1094 Budapest, Hungary, Laboratory and Animal Services, Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Fabrikstrasse 28, 4056 Basel, Switzerland, Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, Avenue de France 15, 1000 Lausanne, Switzerland, Neural Circuit Laboratories, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Maulbeerstrasse 66, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Basel, Mittlere Strasse 91, 4031 Basel, Switzerland, Electronic address:]"

Here, we show that LC activation reliably anticipates changes in pupil diameter that either fluctuate naturally or are driven by external events during near fixation, as in many psychophysical tasks. This relationship occurs on as fine a temporal and spatial scale as single spikes from single units. However, this relationship is not specific to the LC. Similar relationships, albeit with delayed timing and different reliabilities across sites, are evident in the inferior and superior colliculus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Because these regions are interconnected with the LC, the results suggest that non-luminance-mediated changes in pupil diameter might reflect LC-mediated coordination of neuronal activity throughout some parts of the brain.']","Relationships between Pupil Diameter and Neuronal Activity in the Locus Coeruleus, Colliculi, and Cingulate Cortex.",4,Joshua I Gold,Siddhartha Joshi,"[Siddhartha Joshi, Yin Li, Rishi M Kalwani, Joshua I Gold]","[Department of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Electronic address:, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA]"

Here, we examined how patch output is modulated by enkephalin and identified the underlying circuit mechanisms. We found that patches are relatively devoid of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and exist as self-contained inhibitory microcircuits. Enkephalin suppresses inhibition onto striatal projection neurons selectively in patches, thereby disinhibiting their firing in response to cortical input. The majority of this neuromodulation is mediated by delta, not mu-opioid, receptors, acting specifically on intra-striatal collateral axons of striatopallidal neurons.

Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence that JAKMIP1 is a component of polyribosomes and an RNP translational regulatory complex that includes fragile X mental retardation protein, DEAD box helicase 5, and the poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1. JAKMIP1 loss dysregulates neuronal translation during synaptic development, affecting glutamatergic NMDAR signaling, and results in social deficits, stereotyped activity, abnormal postnatal vocalizations, and other autistic-like behaviors in the mouse.

We discovered that each task relies on a sequence of brain processes. These sequences can operate in parallel for several hundred milliseconds but beyond \u223c 500 ms, they repel each other: processes evoked by the first task are shortened, while processes of the second task are either lengthened or postponed.

Overexpression of DCLK2 accelerated growth cone re-formation in vitro and enhanced the initiation and elongation of axon re-growth after optic nerve injury.

Previous studies revealed that disorder-to-order transitions at the effector binding and dimerization sites, which are separated by 33 \xc5, are integral to functional coupling. Perturbations to the transition at the ligand binding site alter both ligand binding and coupled dimerization. Alanine substitutions in four loops on the dimerization surface yield a range of energetic effects on dimerization. A glycine to alanine substitution at position 142 in one of these loops results in a complete loss of allosteric coupling, disruption of the disorder-to-order transitions at both functional sites, and a decreased affinity for the effector. In this work, allosteric communication between the effector binding and dimerization surfaces in BirA was further investigated by performing isothermal titration calorimetry measurements on nine proteins with alanine substitutions in three dimerization surface loops.

In order to test the hypothesis that long loop closure transitions are part of the initiation of the folding pathway, our groups are studying the initiation of the folding transition of a model protein by time-resolved excitation energy transfer (trFRET) detected fast kinetics experiments. Site-specific double labeling is used to study the timing of conformational transitions of individual loop forming chain segments at the microsecond time regime. Previously, it was shown that at least three long loops in the Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AK) molecule close within the first 5 ms of folding of AK, while the main global folding transition occurs in a time regime of seconds. In order to enhance the time resolution of the kinetics experiments to the microsecond time regime and determine the rate of closure of the two N terminal loops (loop I residues 1-26 and loop II residues 29-72), we applied a continuous flow based double kinetics experiment. These measurements enabled us to obtain a microsecond series of transient time dependent distributions of distances between the ends of the labeled loops. Analysis of the trFRET experiments show that the N terminal loop (loop I) is closed within less than 60 \u03bcs after the initiation of refolding.

Hallmarks of the 7-10 amino acid motif are a high variability of LC8 binding affinity and extensive sequence permutation outside the TQT triplet. To elucidate the molecular basis of motif recognition, we use a 69-residue segment of the human Chica spindle adaptor protein that contains four putative TQT recognition motifs in tandem.

These data highlight rigidity in both LC8 residues that bind TQT and in the TQT portion of the motif as an important new characteristic of LC8 recognition.

However, the absorption spectrum of oxy-Fe(II)-HO2 is slightly blue-shifted relative to that of HO1. Furthermore, heme hydroxylation proceeds three times more slowly, and the oxy-Fe(II) state is 100-fold less stable in HO2 than in HO1. These distinctions are attributed to slight structural variances in the two proteins, including differences in equilibrium between open versus closed conformations. Kinetic studies revealed that heme oxygenation by HO2 occurs solely at the catalytic core in that a variant of HO2 lacking the C-terminal HRM domain exhibits the same specific activity as one containing both the catalytic core and HRM domain; furthermore, a truncated variant containing only the HRM region binds but cannot oxidize heme. In summary, HO1 and HO2 share similar catalytic mechanisms, and the HRMs do not play a direct role in the HO2 catalytic cycle.']",Comparison of the Mechanisms of Heme Hydroxylation by Heme Oxygenases-1 and -2: Kinetic and Cryoreduction Studies.,5,Stephen W Ragsdale,Roman Davydov,"[Roman Davydov, Angela S Fleischhacker, Ireena Bagai, Brian M Hoffman, Stephen W Ragsdale]","[Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University , 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, Illinois 60208-3113, United States, Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan Medical School , Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States]"

Furthermore, the mechanism of inactivation is different. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that \u03b2-lactamase inactivation by the new molecule involved formation of an O-alkoxycarbonylhydroxamate with the nucleophilic active site serine residue. This acyl-enzyme did not cyclize to cross-link the active site as did that from the lead compound.

Because the lipids that surround membrane proteins in situ spontaneously organize into bilayers, it may seem intuitive that interactions with the bilayer provide both hydrophobic and topological constraints that help the protein to achieve a stable and functional three-dimensional structure. However, one may wonder whether folding is actually driven by the membrane environment or whether the folded state just reflects an adaptation of integral proteins to the medium in which they function. Also, apart from the overall transmembrane orientation, might the asymmetry inherent in biosynthesis processes cause proteins to fold to out-of-equilibrium, metastable topologies? Which of the features of a bilayer are essential for membrane protein folding, and which are not? To which extent do translocons dictate transmembrane topologies? Recent data show that many membrane proteins fold and oligomerize very efficiently in media that bear little similarity to a membrane, casting doubt on the essentiality of many bilayer constraints. In the following discussion, we argue that some of the features of bilayers may contribute to protein folding, stability and regulation, but they are not required for the basic three-dimensional structure to be achieved. This idea, if correct, would imply that evolution has steered membrane proteins toward an accommodation to biosynthetic pathways and a good fit into their environment, but that their folding is not driven by the latter or dictated by insertion apparatuses.

Activation differences between the variants and TlL were studied by a combination of biophysical and theoretical methods. To investigate the structural changes taking place in the lid region upon lipase activation, we used a fluorescence-based method measuring the efficiency of Trp89 in the lid to quench the fluorescence of a bimane molecule attached in front (C255) and behind (C61) the lid.

NQO2 can exist in either an oxidized state or a reduced state, and binding of compounds to one or both of these states inhibits enzymatic activity and could also affect intracellular signaling. A wide range of planar aromatic compounds bind NQO2, and we have identified three DNA-intercalating agents [ethidium bromide, acridine orange (AO), and doxorubicin] as novel nanomolar inhibitors of NQO2. Ethidium and AO, which carry a positive charge in their aromatic ring systems, bound reduced NQO2 with an affinity 50-fold higher than that of oxidized NQO2, while doxorubicin bound only oxidized NQO2. Crystallographic analyses of oxidized NQO2 in complex with the inhibitors indicated that the inhibitors were situated deep in the active site. The aromatic faces were sandwiched between the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the phenyl ring of F178, with their edges making direct contact with residues lining the active site. In reduced NQO2, ethidium and AO occupied a more peripheral position in the active site, allowing several water molecules to interact with the polar end of the negatively charged isoalloxazine ring. We also showed that AO inhibited NQO2 at a nontoxic concentration in cells while ethidium was less effective at inhibiting NQO2 in cells.

Previous studies have highlighted the presence of protein-protein interactions between SsuE and SsuD thought to be important in the flavin transfer event, but the putative interaction sites have not been identified. Protected sites on specific regions of SsuE and SsuD were identified by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. An \u03b1-helix on SsuD containing conserved charged amino acids showed a decrease in percent deuteration in the presence of SsuE. The \u03b1-helical region of SsuD is part of an insertion sequence and is adjacent to the active site opening. A SsuD variant containing substitutions of the charged residues showed a 4-fold decrease in coupled assays that included SsuE to provide reduced FMN, but there was no activity observed with an SsuD variant containing a deletion of the \u03b1-helix under similar conditions.

Thus, we have examined aspects of the activity, regulation, and structure of PhK at temperatures between 0 and 40 \xb0C. Between 0 and 30 \xb0C, the activity at pH 6.8 of nonphosphorylated PhK predictably increased; however, between 30 and 40 \xb0C, there was a dramatic jump in its activity, resulting in the nonactivated enzyme having a far greater activity at body temperature than was previously realized. This anomalous change in properties between 30 and 40 \xb0C was observed for multiple functions, and both stimulation (by ADP and phosphorylation) and inhibition (by orthophosphate) were considerably less pronounced at 40 \xb0C than at 30 \xb0C. In general, the allosteric control of PhK's activity is definitely more subtle at body temperature. Changes in behavior related to activity at 40 \xb0C and its control can be explained by the near disappearance of hysteresis at physiological temperature. In important ways, the picture of PhK that has emerged from six decades of study at temperatures of \u226430 \xb0C does not coincide with that of the enzyme studied at physiological temperature.

While the hydrolysis of the neurotoxic organophosphates by phosphotriesterase enzymes is well-known, the lack of a labile bond in the flame retardants and plasticizers renders them inert to typical phosphotriesterases.

The instability of DOB-ICLs has made it difficult to learn about their TLS-mediated repair capability and mutagenic potential.

Interestingly, genomewide association studies suggested both positive and negative correlations between T2D risks and activities of a \u03b2-cell-specific zinc transporter upon mutations, which determines zinc concentration in vivo. To decipher the effect of zinc coordination on IAPP aggregation, we performed atomistic discrete molecular dynamics simulations to systemically study aggregation propensities of zinc-coordinated IAPP oligomers with different molecular weights (MWs), whose populations are determined by zinc concentration. We find that at low zinc:IAPP stoichiometry, zinc coordination promotes aggregation by forming high-MW oligomers. The aggregation is inhibited when the stoichiometry increases and zinc binds individual peptides. Our computationally derived predictions are validated by the complementary thioflavin-T fluorescence assay measuring the dependence of IAPP aggregation on a wide range of zinc concentrations.

This process proceeds via three sequential monooxygenation reactions: two hydroxylations of Ch first form 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (HC) and then 20\u03b1,22(R)-dihydroxycholesterol (DHC); a lyase reaction then cleaves the C20-C22 bond to form pregnenolone. Recent cryoreduction/annealing studies that employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)/electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy [Davydov, R., et al. (2012) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134, 17149] showed that compound I (Cpd I) is the active intermediate in the first step, hydroxylation of Ch. Herein, we have employed EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy to characterize the intermediates in the second and third steps of the enzymatic process, as conducted by 77 K radiolytic one-electron cryoreduction and subsequent annealing of the ternary oxy-cytochrome P450scc complexes with HC and DHC. This procedure is validated by showing that the cryoreduced ternary complexes of oxy-cytochrome P450scc with HC and DHC are catalytically competent and during annealing generate DHC and pregnenolone, respectively. Cryoreduction of the oxy-P450scc-HC ternary complex trapped at 77K produces the superoxo-ferrous P450scc intermediate along with a minor fraction of ferric hydroperoxo intermediates. The superoxo-ferrous intermediate converts into a ferric-hydroperoxo species after annealing at 145 K. During subsequent annealing at 170-180 K, the ferric-hydroperoxo intermediate converts to the primary product complex with the large solvent kinetic isotope effect that indicates Cpd I is being formed, and (1)H ENDOR measurements of the primary product formed in D2O demonstrate that Cpd I is the active species. They show that the primary product contains Fe(III) coordinated to the 20-O(1)H of DHC with the (1)H derived from substrate, the signature of the Cpd I reaction. Hydroperoxo ferric intermediates are the primary species formed during cryoreduction of the oxy-P450scc-DHC ternary complex, and they decay at 185 K with a strong solvent kinetic isotope effect to form low-spin ferric P450scc. Together, these observations indicated that Cpd I also is the active intermediate in the C20,22 lyase final step. In combination with our previous results, this study thus indicates that Cpd I is the active species in each of the three sequential monooxygenation reactions by which P450scc catalytically converts Ch to pregnenolone.']",Evidence That Compound I Is the Active Species in Both the Hydroxylase and Lyase Steps by Which P450scc Converts Cholesterol to Pregnenolone: EPR/ENDOR/Cryoreduction/Annealing Studies.,7,Brian M Hoffman,Roman Davydov,"[Roman Davydov, Natallia Strushkevich, David Smil, Aliaksei Yantsevich, Andrey Gilep, Sergey Usanov, Brian M Hoffman]","[Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University , Evanston, Illinois 60208-3113, United States, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus , Kuprevicha Street 5/2, Minsk 220141, Belarus, Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto , 101 College Street, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1L7]"

The pH dependence of catalysis for wild-type So CcP suggests that reduction shifts the pK(a)\'s of at least two amino acids. Mutation of His81 in ""loop 1"", a surface exposed loop thought to shift conformation during the reductive activation process, eliminated one of the pH dependent features, confirming that the loop 1 shifts, changing the environment of His81 during the rate-limiting step. The observed catalytic intermediate has the same electron stoichiometry and similar pH dependence to that previously reported for Ne CcP, which is constitutively active and therefore hypothesized to follow a different catalytic mechanism. The prominent similarities between the rate-limiting steps of differing mechanistic classes of bCcPs suggest unexpected similarities in the intermediates formed.']",Functionally Distinct Bacterial Cytochrome c Peroxidases Proceed through a Common (Electro)catalytic Intermediate.,3,Sean J Elliott,Katherine E Frato,"[Katherine E Frato, Kelly A Walsh, Sean J Elliott]","[Department of Chemistry, Boston University , 590 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, United States]"

We therefore conducted a chemical screen with commercial and in-house natural product libraries using a cell-based H-ras-nanoclustering FRET assay. Next to established Ras inhibitors, such as a statin and farnesyl-transferase inhibitor, we surprisingly identified five protein synthesis inhibitors as positive regulators.

SIK1 expression is rapidly induced in Y1 adrenal cells in response to ACTH via the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade, and it has been suggested that an increased level of SIK1 expression inhibits adrenal steroidogenesis by repressing the cAMP-dependent transcription of steroidogenic proteins, CYP11A1 and StAR, by attenuating CREB transcriptional activity. Here we show that SIK1 stimulates adrenal steroidogenesis by modulating the selective HDL-CE transport activity of SR-B1. Overexpression of SIK1 increases cAMP-stimulated and SR-B1-mediated selective HDL-BODIPY-CE uptake in cell lines without impacting SR-B1 protein levels, whereas knockdown of SIK1 attenuated cAMP-stimulated selective HDL-BODIPY-CE uptake. SIK1 forms a complex with SR-B1 by interacting with its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, and in vitro kinase activity measurements indicate that SIK1 can phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of SR-B1. Among potential phosphorylation sites, SIK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser496 is critical for SIK1 stimulation of the selective CE transport activity of SR-B1. Mutational studies further demonstrated that both the intact catalytic activity of SIK1 and its PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation are essential for SIK1 stimulation of SR-B1 activity. Finally, overexpression of SIK1 caused time-dependent increases in SR-B1-mediated and HDL-supported steroid production in Y1 cells; however, these effects were lost with knockdown of SR-B1.

In preparation for testing the long-range effects of mutations of distal residues for future studies, we examined the extent of measurable perturbation of the four conserved residues by determination of the conformation and relative affinities of these BMPR-1B mutants for ligands BMP-2, -6, and -7 and GDF-5. Results suggest no significant structural changes in the receptor but do suggest that the four residues play different roles in defining ligand affinity and both intra- and intermolecular interactions play a role in defining ligand affinity.

In this work, we have studied RNA hairpins derived from the M. tuberculosis A-site, the wild type and three mutants at the following positions (M. tuberculosis/Escherichia coli numbering): A1400/1408 \u2192 G, C1401/1409 \u2192 U, and the double mutant G1483/1491 C1401/1409 \u2192 UA.

Our results show that the mutations affect the conformation of the decoding site, with the mutations at position 1401/1409 resulting in significant destabilizations. Interestingly, the mutants bind paromomycin with weaker affinity than the wild type, but they bind kanamycin-B with similar affinity than the wild type. The results suggest that the presence of mutations does not prevent kanamycin-B from binding. Instead, kanamycin may promote different interactions with a third partner in the mutants compared to the wild type.

The potent activity of these compounds against antibiotic-resistant pathogens like MRSA and their novel mode of action have garnered considerable interest for the development of these peptides into clinically relevant antibiotics. This goal has been hampered, at least in part, by the fact that L-End is difficult to synthesize and not currently commercially available. We have begun to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of this unusual building block. In mannopeptimycin-producing strains, like Streptomyces wadayamensis, L-End is produced from L-Arg by the action of three enzymes: MppP, MppQ, and MppR.

The structure of MppP with PLP bound to the catalytic lysine residue (Lys221) shows that, while the tertiary structure is very similar to those of the well-studied aminotransferases, there are differences in the arrangement of active site residues around the cofactor that likely account for the unusual activity of this enzyme.

High-affinity ATP binding is induced by the presence of Na(+) as well as of Na-like substances such as Tris(+), and these ions are equally efficient promoters of nucleotide binding.

Differences in chemical shifts for ATP atoms C1' and C5' observed in the presence of Na(+) or Tris(+) suggest alterations in the residues surrounding the bound nucleotide, hydrogen bonding, and/or conformation of the ribose ring. This is taken as evidence of a long-distance communication between the Na(+)-filled ion sites in the membrane interior and the nucleotide binding site in the cytoplasmic domain and reflects the first conformational change ultimately leading to phosphorylation of the enzyme.

The ability of Msmeg CYP125A4 (and Mtb CYP125A1) to oxidize 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol is due, at least in part, to the presence of a smaller amino acid side chain facing C-7 of the sterol substrate than in CYP125A3. The ability to oxidize 7-substituted steroids broadens the range of sterol carbon sources for growth, but even more importantly in Mtb, additional biological effects are possible due to the potent immunomodulatory activity of 7\u03b1,26-dihydroxycholesterol.']","Cytochrome P450 125A4, the Third Cholesterol C-26 Hydroxylase from Mycobacterium smegmatis.",4,Paul R Ortiz de Montellano,Daniel J Frank,"[Daniel J Frank, Christopher A Waddling, Maggie La, Paul R Ortiz de Montellano]","[Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California , San Francisco, California 94158-2517, United States, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California , San Francisco, California 94158-2517, United States]"

The third type III domain (3FN3) in fibronectin interacts with other parts of fibronectin and with anastellin, a protein fragment that causes fibronectin aggregation. 3FN3 opens readily both as an isolated domain in solution and when part of fibronectin in stretched fibrils, and it was proposed that this opening is important for anastellin binding. We determined the structure of 3FN3 using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and we investigated its stability, folding, and unfolding. Similar to most other FN3 domains, 3FN3 contains two antiparallel \u03b2-sheets that are composed of three (A, B, and E) and four (C, D, F, and G) \u03b2-strands, respectively, and are held together by a conserved hydrophobic interface. cis-trans isomerization of P847 at the end of \u03b2-strand C leads to observable conformational heterogeneity in 3FN3, with a cis peptide bond present in almost one-quarter of the molecules. The chemical stability of 3FN3 is relatively low, but the folding rate constant in the absence of denaturant is in the same range as those of other, more stable FN3 domains. Interestingly, the unfolding rate constant in the absence of denaturant is several orders of magnitude higher than the unfolding rate constants of other FN3 domains investigated to date. This unusually fast rate is comparable to the rate of binding of 3FN3 to anastellin at saturating anastellin concentrations, consistent with the model in which 3FN3 has to unfold to interact with anastellin.']",Structure and unfolding of the third type III domain from human fibronectin.,5,Klára Briknarová,Jessica M Stine,"[Jessica M Stine, Yizhi Sun, Geoffrey Armstrong, Bruce E Bowler, Klára Briknarová]","[Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Montana , Missoula, Montana 59812, United States, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States]"

Both proteins use tandem calponin-homology (CH) domains to bind to F-actin. We probed the role of N-terminal CH1 and C-terminal CH2 domains in the structure and function of dystrophin tandem CH domain and compared with our earlier results on utrophin to understand the unifying principles of how tandem CH domains work. Actin cosedimentation assays indicate that the isolated CH2 domain of dystrophin weakly binds to F-actin compared to the full-length tandem CH domain. In contrast, the isolated CH1 domain binds to F-actin with an affinity similar to that of the full-length tandem CH domain. Thus, the obvious question is why the dystrophin tandem CH domain requires CH2, when its actin binding is determined primarily by CH1. To answer, we probed the structural stabilities of CH domains. The isolated CH1 domain is very unstable and is prone to serious aggregation. The isolated CH2 domain is very stable, similar to the full-length tandem CH domain. These results indicate that the main role of CH2 is to stabilize the tandem CH domain structure. These conclusions from dystrophin agree with our earlier results on utrophin, indicating that this phenomenon of differential contribution of CH domains to the structure and function of tandem CH domains may be quite general. The N-terminal CH1 domains primarily determine the actin binding function whereas the C-terminal CH2 domains primarily determine the structural stability of tandem CH domains, and the extent of stabilization depends on the strength of inter-CH domain interactions.']",The N- and C-Terminal Domains Differentially Contribute to the Structure and Function of Dystrophin and Utrophin Tandem Calponin-Homology Domains.,3,Krishna M G Mallela,Surinder M Singh,"[Surinder M Singh, Swati Bandi, Krishna M G Mallela]","[Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and ‡Program in Structural Biology and Biochemistry, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus , Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States]"

There is a growing appreciation that lysosomes act as sensors of stress and the metabolic state of the cell through the kinase mTOR. Here we show that LPS stimulates mTOR and that mTOR is required for LPS-induced lysosome tubulation and secretion of major histocompatibility complex II in macrophages and dendritic cells. Specifically, we show that the canonical phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway regulates LPS-induced lysosome tubulation independently of IRAK1/4 and TBK. Of note, we find that LPS treatment augmented the levels of membrane-associated Arl8b, a lysosomal GTPase required for tubulation that promotes kinesin-dependent lysosome movement to the cell periphery, in an mTOR-dependent manner. This suggests that mTOR may interface with the Arl8b-kinesin machinery. To further support this notion, we show that mTOR antagonists can block outward movement of lysosomes in cells treated with acetate but have no effect in retrograde movement upon acetate removal.

We describe a proteomic and genetic approach that connects the J-domain chaperone auxilin, which uncoats clathrin-coated vesicles, to COPII and COPI coat complexes. Consistent with a functional role for auxilin in the early secretory pathway, auxilin binds to COPII and COPI coat subunits. Furthermore, ER-Golgi and intra-Golgi traffic is delayed at 15\xb0C in swa2\u0394 mutant cells, which lack auxilin. In the case of COPII vesicles, we link this delay to a defect in vesicle fusion.

Additionally, KLHL20 governs the degradation of ATG13, VPS34, Beclin-1, and ATG14 in prolonged starvation through a direct or indirect mechanism. Impairment of KLHL20-mediated regulation of autophagy dynamics potentiates starvation-induced cell death and aggravates diabetes-associated muscle atrophy. Our study identifies a key role of KLHL20 in autophagy termination by controlling autophagy-dependent turnover of ULK1 and VPS34 complex subunits and reveals the pathophysiological functions of this autophagy termination mechanism.']",Cul3-KLHL20 Ubiquitin Ligase Governs the Turnover of ULK1 and VPS34 Complexes to Control Autophagy Termination.,11,Ruey-Hwa Chen,Chin-Chih Liu,"[Chin-Chih Liu, Yu-Ching Lin, Yu-Hsuan Chen, Chun-Ming Chen, Liang-Yu Pang, Hsuan-An Chen, Pei-Rung Wu, Mei-Yao Lin, Si-Tse Jiang, Ting-Fen Tsai, Ruey-Hwa Chen]","[Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemical Sciences, College of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan, Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan, Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan, Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan, Department of Life Sciences and Institute of Genome Sciences, National Yang Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan, Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemical Sciences, College of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan, Electronic address:]"

Here, we demonstrate that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a conventional glycolytic enzyme, is a critical mediator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-driven Sirt1 activation. Under glucose starvation, but not amino acid starvation, cytoplasmic GAPDH is phosphorylated on Ser122 by activated AMPK. This causes GAPDH to redistribute into the nucleus.

A more detailed understanding of these concepts will, for example, help to improve the design of increasingly smaller devices such as micro- and nanoelectromechanical switches.

Stiction and adhesion can be reversibly switched by applying different electrochemical potentials to the sample, causing atomic hydrogen to be intercalated or not.

This ascent is driven by buoyancy forces, which are enhanced by bubble nucleation and growth (vesiculation) that reduce the density of magma. The development of vesicularity also greatly reduces the 'strength' of magma, a material parameter controlling fragmentation and thus the explosive potential of the liquid rock. The development of vesicularity in magmas has until now been viewed (both thermodynamically and kinetically) in terms of the pressure dependence of the solubility of water in the magma, and its role in driving gas saturation, exsolution and expansion during decompression. In contrast, the possible effects of the well documented negative temperature dependence of solubility of water in magma has largely been ignored. Recently, petrological constraints have demonstrated that considerable heating of magma may indeed be a common result of the latent heat of crystallization as well as viscous and frictional heating in areas of strain localization. Here we present field and experimental observations of magma vesiculation and fragmentation resulting from heating (rather than decompression). Textural analysis of volcanic ash from Santiaguito volcano in Guatemala reveals the presence of chemically heterogeneous filaments hosting micrometre-scale vesicles. The textures mirror those developed by disequilibrium melting induced via rapid heating during fault friction experiments, demonstrating that friction can generate sufficient heat to induce melting and vesiculation of hydrated silicic magma. Consideration of the experimentally determined temperature and pressure dependence of water solubility in magma reveals that, for many ascent paths, exsolution may be more efficiently achieved by heating than by decompression.

Matter-wave interferometers, which split and recombine wave packets in order to observe interference, provide a way to probe the superposition principle on macroscopic scales and explore the transition to classical physics. In such experiments, large wave-packet separation is impeded by the need for long interaction times and large momentum beam splitters, which cause susceptibility to dephasing and decoherence.

In many cases, this magnetic energy is stored in long-lived, arched structures called magnetic flux ropes. When a flux rope destabilizes, it can either erupt and produce a coronal mass ejection or fail and collapse back towards the Sun. The prevailing belief is that the outcome of a given event is determined by a magnetohydrodynamic force imbalance called the torus instability. This belief is challenged, however, by observations indicating that torus-unstable flux ropes sometimes fail to erupt. This contradiction has not yet been resolved because of a lack of coronal magnetic field measurements and the limitations of idealized numerical modelling. Here we report the results of a laboratory experiment that reveal a previously unknown eruption criterion below which torus-unstable flux ropes fail to erupt. We find that such 'failed torus' events occur when the guide magnetic field (that is, the ambient field that runs toroidally along the flux rope) is strong enough to prevent the flux rope from kinking. Under these conditions, the guide field interacts with electric currents in the flux rope to produce a dynamic toroidal field tension force that halts the eruption.

IDH mutant gliomas thus manifest a CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), although the functional importance of this altered epigenetic state remains unclear. Here we show that human IDH mutant gliomas exhibit hypermethylation at cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-binding sites, compromising binding of this methylation-sensitive insulator protein. Reduced CTCF binding is associated with loss of insulation between topological domains and aberrant gene activation. We specifically demonstrate that loss of CTCF at a domain boundary permits a constitutive enhancer to interact aberrantly with the receptor tyrosine kinase gene PDGFRA, a prominent glioma oncogene. Treatment of IDH mutant gliomaspheres with a demethylating agent partially restores insulator function and downregulates PDGFRA. Conversely, CRISPR-mediated disruption of the CTCF motif in IDH wild-type gliomaspheres upregulates PDGFRA and increases proliferation. Our study suggests that IDH mutations promote gliomagenesis by disrupting chromosomal topology and allowing aberrant regulatory interactions that induce oncogene expression.""]",Insulator dysfunction and oncogene activation in IDH mutant gliomas.,8,Bradley E Bernstein,William A Flavahan,"[William A Flavahan, Yotam Drier, Brian B Liau, Shawn M Gillespie, Andrew S Venteicher, Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov, Mario L Suvà, Bradley E Bernstein]","[Department of Pathology and Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA]"

Here we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that recognize erythrocytes infected by different P. falciparum isolates and opsonize these cells by binding to members of the RIFIN family. These antibodies acquired broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large DNA fragment between the V and DJ segments. The insert, which is both necessary and sufficient for binding to RIFINs, encodes the entire 98 amino acid collagen-binding domain of LAIR1, an immunoglobulin superfamily inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 19. In each of the two donors studied, the antibodies are produced by a single expanded B-cell clone and carry distinct somatic mutations in the LAIR1 domain that abolish binding to collagen and increase binding to infected erythrocytes.

Indeed, complete electric-field control of many-body states in strongly correlated electron systems is fundamental to the next generation of condensed matter research and devices. However, the material must be thin enough to avoid shielding of the electric field in the bulk material. Two-dimensional materials do not experience electrical screening, and their charge-carrier density can be controlled by gating. Octahedral titanium diselenide (1T-TiSe2) is a prototypical two-dimensional material that reveals a charge-density wave (CDW) and superconductivity in its phase diagram, presenting several similarities with other layered systems such as copper oxides, iron pnictides, and crystals of rare-earth elements and actinide atoms. By studying 1T-TiSe2 single crystals with thicknesses of 10 nanometres or less, encapsulated in two-dimensional layers of hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve unprecedented control over the CDW transition temperature (tuned from 170\u2009kelvin to 40\u2009kelvin), and over the superconductivity transition temperature (tuned from a quantum critical point at 0\u2009kelvin up to 3\u2009kelvin). Electrically driving TiSe2 over different ordered electronic phases allows us to study the details of the phase transitions between many-body states. Observations of periodic oscillations of magnetoresistance induced by the Little-Parks effect show that the appearance of superconductivity is directly correlated with the spatial texturing of the amplitude and phase of the superconductivity order parameter, corresponding to a two-dimensional matrix of superconductivity. We infer that this superconductivity matrix is supported by a matrix of incommensurate CDW states embedded in the commensurate CDW states. Our results show that spatially modulated electronic states are fundamental to the appearance of two-dimensional superconductivity.']",Controlling many-body states by the electric-field effect in a two-dimensional material.,6,A H Castro Neto,L J Li,"[L J Li, E C T O'Farrell, K P Loh, G Eda, B Özyilmaz, A H Castro Neto]","[Centre for Advanced 2D Materials and Graphene Research Centre, National University of Singapore, 117546, Singapore]"

Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height.

Using carbon dioxide as a feedstock to produce synthetic fuels might, in principle, alleviate these concerns. Although many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, further deoxygenative coupling of carbon monoxide to generate useful multicarbon products is challenging. Molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases are capable of converting carbon monoxide into hydrocarbons under mild conditions, using discrete electron and proton sources. Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide on copper catalysts also uses a combination of electrons and protons, while the industrial Fischer-Tropsch process uses dihydrogen as a combined source of electrons and electrophiles for carbon monoxide coupling at high temperatures and pressures. However, these enzymatic and heterogeneous systems are difficult to probe mechanistically. Molecular catalysts have been studied extensively to investigate the elementary steps by which carbon monoxide is deoxygenated and coupled, but a single metal site that can efficiently induce the required scission of carbon-oxygen bonds and generate carbon-carbon bonds has not yet been documented. Here we describe a molybdenum compound, supported by a terphenyl-diphosphine ligand, that activates and cleaves the strong carbon-oxygen bond of carbon monoxide, enacts carbon-carbon coupling, and spontaneously dissociates the resulting fragment. This complex four-electron transformation is enabled by the terphenyl-diphosphine ligand, which acts as an electron reservoir and exhibits the coordinative flexibility needed to stabilize the different intermediates involved in the overall reaction sequence.

Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.']",Competition between DNA methylation and transcription factors determines binding of NRF1.,6,Dirk Schübeler,Silvia Domcke,"[Silvia Domcke, Anaïs Flore Bardet, Paul Adrian Ginno, Dominik Hartl, Lukas Burger, Dirk Schübeler]","[Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Maulbeerstrasse 66, CH 4058 Basel, Switzerland]"

Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres.

Here we evaluate changes in plant and animal community organization over geological time by quantifying the co-occurrence structure of 359,896 unique taxon pairs in 80 assemblages spanning the past 300 million years. Co-occurrences of most taxon pairs were statistically random, but a significant fraction were spatially aggregated or segregated.

The shift began during the Holocene and coincided with increasing human population size and the spread of agriculture in North America. Before the shift, an average of 64% of significant pairs were aggregated; after the shift, the average dropped to 37%.

Consequently, no observation-based estimates of the contribution from the GIS to the global-mean sea level budget before 1990 are included in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Here we calculate spatial ice mass loss around the entire GIS from 1900 to the present using aerial imagery from the 1980s. This allows accurate high-resolution mapping of geomorphic features related to the maximum extent of the GIS during the Little Ice Age at the end of the nineteenth century.

For trapped ions, a hybrid system formed of different species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be exploited to expand and refine the control of the system. Ions of different elements have previously been used in QIP experiments for sympathetic cooling, creation of entanglement through dissipation, and quantum non-demolition measurement of one species with another.

We observed that dicentric chromosomes invariably persisted through mitosis and developed into 50-200\xa0\u03bcm chromatin bridges connecting the daughter cells. Before their resolution at 3-20\xa0hr after anaphase, the chromatin bridges induced nuclear envelope rupture in interphase, accumulated the cytoplasmic 3' nuclease TREX1, and developed RPA-coated single stranded (ss) DNA. CRISPR knockouts showed that TREX1 contributed to the generation of the ssDNA and the resolution of the chromatin bridges. Post-crisis clones showed chromothripsis and kataegis, presumably resulting from DNA repair and APOBEC editing of the fragmented chromatin bridge DNA.

The ring is formed by two SMC subunits, closed at a pair of ATPase heads, whose interaction is reinforced by a kleisin subunit. Using biochemical analysis of fission-yeast cohesin, we find that a similar series of events facilitates both topological entrapment and release of DNA. DNA-sensing lysines trigger ATP hydrolysis to open the SMC head interface, whereas the Wapl subunit disengages kleisin, but only after ATP rebinds. This suggests an interlocking gate mechanism for DNA transport both into and out of the cohesin ring. The entry direction is facilitated by a cohesin loader that appears to fold cohesin to expose the DNA sensor. Our results provide a model for dynamic DNA binding by all members of the SMC family and explain how lysine acetylation of cohesin establishes enduring sister chromatid cohesion.']",DNA Entry into and Exit out of the Cohesin Ring by an Interlocking Gate Mechanism.,2,Frank Uhlmann,Yasuto Murayama,"[Yasuto Murayama, Frank Uhlmann]","[The Francis Crick Institute, Lincoln's Inn Fields Laboratory, London WC2A 3LY, UK, Electronic address:]"

Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression.

TERB1/2-MAJIN initially assembles on the INM sequestered by its putative transmembrane subunit MAJIN. In early meiosis, telomere attachment is achieved by the formation of a chimeric complex of TERB1/2-MAJIN and shelterin. The chimeric complex matures during prophase into DNA-bound TERB1/2-MAJIN by releasing shelterin, forming a direct link between telomeric DNA and the INM.

Here, we present evidence that in Drosophila, endocrine release of the steroid hormone ecdysone is mediated through a regulated vesicular trafficking mechanism. Inhibition of calcium signaling in the steroidogenic prothoracic gland results in the accumulation of unreleased ecdysone, and the knockdown of calcium-mediated vesicle exocytosis components in the gland caused developmental defects due to deficiency of ecdysone. Accumulation of synaptotagmin-labeled vesicles in the gland is observed when calcium signaling is disrupted, and these vesicles contain an ABC transporter that functions as an ecdysone pump to fill vesicles. We propose that trafficking of steroid hormones out of endocrine cells is not always through a simple diffusion mechanism as presently thought, but instead can involve a regulated vesicle-mediated release process.']",Vesicle-Mediated Steroid Hormone Secretion in Drosophila melanogaster.,3,Michael B O'Connor,Naoki Yamanaka,"[Naoki Yamanaka, Guillermo Marqués, Michael B O'Connor]","[Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Entomology, Institute for Integrative Genome Biology, Center for Disease Vector Research, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521, USA, Electronic address:, University Imaging Centers, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA, Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA]"

Zero species are known prior to ~380 million years ago, and more than 30,000 are present today. An expansionist model suggests this was achieved by large and unbounded increases, leading to substantially greater diversity in the present than at any time in the geological past. This model contrasts starkly with empirical support for constrained diversification in marine animals, suggesting different macroevolutionary processes on land and in the sea. We quantify patterns of vertebrate standing diversity on land during the Mesozoic-early Paleogene interval, applying sample-standardization to a global fossil dataset containing 27,260 occurrences of 4,898 non-marine tetrapod species. Our results show a highly stable pattern of Mesozoic tetrapod diversity at regional and local levels, underpinned by a weakly positive, but near-zero, long-term net diversification rate over 190 million years. Species diversity of non-flying terrestrial tetrapods less than doubled over this interval, despite the origins of exceptionally diverse extant groups within mammals, squamates, amphibians, and dinosaurs. Therefore, although speciose groups of modern tetrapods have Mesozoic origins, rates of Mesozoic diversification inferred from the fossil record are slow compared to those inferred from molecular phylogenies. If high speciation rates did occur in the Mesozoic, then they seem to have been balanced by extinctions among older clades. An apparent 4-fold expansion of species richness after the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary deserves further examination in light of potential taxonomic biases, but is consistent with the hypothesis that global environmental disturbances such as mass extinction events can rapidly adjust limits to diversity by restructuring ecosystems, and suggests that the gradualistic evolutionary diversification of tetrapods was punctuated by brief but dramatic episodes of radiation.']",Near-Stasis in the Long-Term Diversification of Mesozoic Tetrapods.,6,Graeme T Lloyd,Roger B J Benson,"[Roger B J Benson, Richard J Butler, John Alroy, Philip D Mannion, Matthew T Carrano, Graeme T Lloyd]","[Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom, School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom, Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, New South Wales, Australia, Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, Department of Paleobiology, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D, C, , United States of America]"

Host-associated microbial community structures are affected by abiotic and host factors, and increased attention is given to the role of the microbiome in interactions such as pathogen inhibition. However, little is known about how these factors act on the microbial community, and especially what role microbe-microbe interaction dynamics play. We have begun to address this knowledge gap for phyllosphere microbiomes of plants by simultaneously studying three major groups of Arabidopsis thaliana symbionts (bacteria, fungi and oomycetes) using a systems biology approach. We evaluated multiple potential factors of microbial community control: we sampled various wild A. thaliana populations at different times, performed field plantings with different host genotypes, and implemented successive host colonization experiments under lab conditions where abiotic factors, host genotype, and pathogen colonization was manipulated. Our results indicate that both abiotic factors and host genotype interact to affect plant colonization by all three groups of microbes. Considering microbe-microbe interactions, however, uncovered a network of interkingdom interactions with significant contributions to community structure. As in other scale-free networks, a small number of taxa, which we call microbial ""hubs,"" are strongly interconnected and have a severe effect on communities. By documenting these microbe-microbe interactions, we uncover an important mechanism explaining how abiotic factors and host genotypic signatures control microbial communities. In short, they act directly on ""hub"" microbes, which, via microbe-microbe interactions, transmit the effects to the microbial community. We analyzed two ""hub"" microbes (the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen Albugo and the basidiomycete yeast fungus Dioszegia) more closely. Albugo had strong effects on epiphytic and endophytic bacterial colonization. Specifically, alpha diversity decreased and beta diversity stabilized in the presence of Albugo infection, whereas they otherwise varied between plants. Dioszegia, on the other hand, provided evidence for direct hub interaction with phyllosphere bacteria. The identification of microbial ""hubs"" and their importance in phyllosphere microbiome structuring has crucial implications for plant-pathogen and microbe-microbe research and opens new entry points for ecosystem management and future targeted biocontrol. The revelation that effects can cascade through communities via ""hub"" microbes is important to understand community structure perturbations in parallel fields including human microbiomes and bioprocesses.

We hypothesise that these modules in non-coding sequence represent distinct cis-regulatory loci that control expression of the transcription factor optix, which in turn controls red pattern variation across Heliconius. Phylogenetic analysis of the two elements demonstrated that they have distinct evolutionary histories and that novel adaptive morphological variation was created by shuffling these cis-regulatory modules through recombination between divergent lineages. In addition, recombination of modules into different combinations within species further contributes to diversity. Analysis of the timing of diversification in these two regions supports the hypothesis of introgression moving regulatory modules between species, rather than shared ancestral variation. The dennis phenotype introgressed into Heliconius melpomene at about the same time that ray originated in this group, while ray introgressed back into H. elevatus much more recently.

The stimulatory or inhibitory effects of WH on FEN1's flap versus gap endonuclease activities are consistent with the proposed WH's functions in protecting the integrity of replication fork.

Whereas much is known about the macroscopic mechanisms underlying cross-modal plasticity, only scant information exists about its cellular and molecular underpinnings. We found that Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes deprived of a sense of body touch exhibit various changes in behavior, associated with other unimpaired senses. We focused on one such behavioral alteration, enhanced odor sensation, and sought to reveal the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that translate mechanosensory loss into improved olfactory acuity. To this end, we analyzed in mechanosensory mutants food-dependent locomotion patterns that are associated with olfactory responses and found changes that are consistent with enhanced olfaction. The altered locomotion could be reversed in adults by optogenetic stimulation of the touch receptor (mechanosensory) neurons. Furthermore, we revealed that the enhanced odor response is related to a strengthening of inhibitory AWC\u2192AIY synaptic transmission in the olfactory circuit. Consistently, inserting in this circuit an engineered electrical synapse that diminishes AWC inhibition of AIY counteracted the locomotion changes in touch-deficient mutants. We found that this cross-modal signaling between the mechanosensory and olfactory circuits is mediated by neuropeptides, one of which we identified as FLP-20. Our results indicate that under normal function, ongoing touch receptor neuron activation evokes FLP-20 release, suppressing synaptic communication and thus dampening odor sensation. In contrast, in the absence of mechanosensory input, FLP-20 signaling is reduced, synaptic suppression is released, and this enables enhanced olfactory acuity; these changes are long lasting and do not represent ongoing modulation, as revealed by optogenetic experiments. Our work adds to a growing literature on the roles of neuropeptides in cross-modal signaling, by showing how activity-dependent neuropeptide signaling leads to specific cross-modal plastic changes in neural circuit connectivity, enhancing sensory performance.']",Neuropeptide-Driven Cross-Modal Plasticity following Sensory Loss in Caenorhabditis elegans.,9,Millet Treinin,Ithai Rabinowitch,"[Ithai Rabinowitch, Patrick Laurent, Buyun Zhao, Denise Walker, Isabel Beets, Liliane Schoofs, Jihong Bai, William R Schafer, Millet Treinin]","[Department of Medical Neurobiology, Hadassah Medical School, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel, Neurobiology Division, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom, Functional Genomics and Proteomics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America]"

Animal-vegetal oocyte polarity is established by the Balbiani body (Bb), a conserved structure found in all animals examined that contains an aggregate of specific mRNAs, proteins, and organelles. The Bb specifies the oocyte vegetal pole, which is key to forming the embryonic body axes as well as the germline in most vertebrates. How Bb formation is regulated and how its asymmetric position is established are unknown. Using quantitative image analysis, we trace oocyte symmetry breaking in zebrafish to a nuclear asymmetry at the onset of meiosis called the chromosomal bouquet. The bouquet is a universal feature of meiosis where all telomeres cluster to one pole on the nuclear envelope, facilitating chromosomal pairing and meiotic recombination. We show that Bb precursor components first localize with the centrosome to the cytoplasm adjacent to the telomere cluster of the bouquet. They then aggregate around the centrosome in a specialized nuclear cleft that we identified, assembling the early Bb. We show that the bouquet nuclear events and the cytoplasmic Bb precursor localization are mechanistically coordinated by microtubules. Thus the animal-vegetal axis of the oocyte is aligned to the nuclear axis of the bouquet. We further show that the symmetry breaking events lay upstream to the only known regulator of Bb formation, the Bucky ball protein. Our findings link two universal features of oogenesis, the Bb and the chromosomal bouquet, to oocyte polarization. We propose that a meiotic-vegetal center couples meiosis and oocyte patterning. Our findings reveal a novel mode of cellular polarization in meiotic cells whereby cellular and nuclear polarity are aligned. We further reveal that in zygotene nests, intercellular cytoplasmic bridges remain between oocytes and that the position of the cytoplasmic bridge coincides with the location of the centrosome meiotic-vegetal organizing center. These results suggest that centrosome positioning is set by the last mitotic oogonial division plane. Thus, oocytes are polarized in two steps: first, mitotic divisions preset the centrosome with no obvious polarization yet, then the meiotic-vegetal center forms at zygotene bouquet stages, when symmetry is, in effect, broken.']","Oocyte Polarization Is Coupled to the Chromosomal Bouquet, a Conserved Polarized Nuclear Configuration in Meiosis.",3,Mary C Mullins,Yaniv M Elkouby,"[Yaniv M Elkouby, Allison Jamieson-Lucy, Mary C Mullins]","[Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America]"

Here, as facilitated by our previous discovery, by circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have successfully determined conformations, dynamics, and self-associations of the full-length prion-like domains of the wild type and three ALS-causing mutants (A315E, Q331K, and M337V) in both aqueous solutions and membrane environments. The study decodes the following: (1) The TDP-43 prion-like domain is intrinsically disordered only with some nascent secondary structures in aqueous solutions, but owns the capacity to assemble into dynamic oligomers rich in \u03b2-sheet structures. By contrast, despite having highly similar conformations, three mutants gained the ability to form amyloid oligomers. The wild type and three mutants all formed amyloid fibrils after incubation as imaged by electron microscopy. (2) The interaction with nucleic acid enhances the self-assembly for the wild type but triggers quick aggregation for three mutants. (3) A membrane-interacting subdomain has been identified over residues Met311-Gln343 indispensable for TDP-43 neurotoxicity, which transforms into a well-folded \u03a9-loop-helix structure in membrane environments. Furthermore, despite having very similar membrane-embedded conformations, three mutants will undergo further self-association in the membrane environment. Our study implies that the TDP-43 prion-like domain appears to have an energy landscape, which allows the assembly of the wild-type sequence into dynamic oligomers only under very limited condition sets, and ALS-causing point mutations are sufficient to remodel it to more favor the amyloid formation or irreversible aggregation, thus supporting the emerging view that the pathologic aggregation may occur via the exaggeration of functionally important assemblies. Furthermore, the coupled capacity of TDP-43 in aggregation and membrane interaction may critically account for its high neurotoxicity, and therefore its decoupling may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to treat TDP-43 causing neurodegenerative diseases.']",ALS-Causing Mutations Significantly Perturb the Self-Assembly and Interaction with Nucleic Acid of the Intrinsically Disordered Prion-Like Domain of TDP-43.,4,Jianxing Song,Liangzhong Lim,"[Liangzhong Lim, Yuanyuan Wei, Yimei Lu, Jianxing Song]","[Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore, NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore]"

In plants, the RNaseIII enzyme DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) produces miRNAs, whereas DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 produce various size classes of siRNAs. Plants also encode RNASE THREE-LIKE (RTL) enzymes that lack DCL-specific domains and whose function is largely unknown. We found that virus infection induces RTL1 expression, suggesting that this enzyme could play a role in plant-virus interaction. To first investigate the biochemical activity of RTL1 independent of virus infection, small RNAs were sequenced from transgenic plants constitutively expressing RTL1. These plants lacked almost all DCL2-, DCL3-, and DCL4-dependent small RNAs, indicating that RTL1 is a general suppressor of plant siRNA pathways. In vivo and in vitro assays revealed that RTL1 prevents siRNA production by cleaving dsRNA prior to DCL2-, DCL3-, and DCL4-processing. The substrate of RTL1 cleavage is likely long-perfect (or near-perfect) dsRNA, consistent with the RTL1-insensitivity of miRNAs, which derive from DCL1-processing of short-imperfect dsRNA. Virus infection induces RTL1 mRNA accumulation, but viral proteins that suppress RNA silencing inhibit RTL1 activity, suggesting that RTL1 has evolved as an inducible antiviral defense that could target dsRNA intermediates of viral replication, but that a broad range of viruses counteract RTL1 using the same protein toolbox used to inhibit antiviral RNA silencing. Together, these results reveal yet another level of complexity in the evolutionary battle between viruses and plant defenses.']",Plants Encode a General siRNA Suppressor That Is Induced and Suppressed by Viruses.,10,Hervé Vaucheret,Nahid Shamandi,"[Nahid Shamandi, Matthias Zytnicki, Cyril Charbonnel, Emilie Elvira-Matelot, Aurore Bochnakian, Pascale Comella, Allison C Mallory, Gersende Lepère, Julio Sáez-Vásquez, Hervé Vaucheret]","[Institut Jean-Pierre Bourgin, UMR 1318, INRA AgroParisTech CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, Versailles, France, URGI, INRA, Versailles, France, CNRS, UMR 5096, LGDP, Perpignan, France]"

The causes of this bias are commonly discussed in the context of sexual antagonism and the avoidance of activity in the male germline. Here, we examine the notion that, at least in some taxa, functionally biased gene content may more profoundly be shaped by limits imposed on gene expression owing to haploid expression of the X chromosome. Notably, if the X, as in primates, is transcribed at rates comparable to the ancestral rate (per promoter) prior to the X chromosome formation, then the X is not a tolerable environment for genes with very high maximal net levels of expression, owing to transcriptional traffic jams. We test this hypothesis using The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and data from the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project. As predicted, the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes: on average, maximal expression is three times lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Similarly, autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. Also as expected, X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal ones (compared to the human/Chimpanzee common ancestor) if highly expressed, but not if lowly expressed. The traffic jam model also explains the known lower breadth of expression for genes on the X (and the Z of birds), as genes with broad expression are, on average, those with high maximal expression. As then further predicted, highly expressed tissue-specific genes are also rare on the X and broadly expressed genes on the X tend to be lowly expressed, both indicating that the trend is shaped by the maximal expression level not the breadth of expression per se. Importantly, a limit to the maximal expression level explains biased tissue of expression profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues whose tissue-specific genes are very highly expressed (e.g., secretory tissues, tissues abundant in structural proteins) are also tissues in which gene expression is relatively rare on the X chromosome. These trends cannot be fully accounted for in terms of alternative models of biased expression. In conclusion, the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, provides a simple yet robustly supported rationale of many peculiar features of X's gene content, gene expression, and evolution.""]",The Constrained Maximal Expression Level Owing to Haploidy Shapes Gene Content on the Mammalian X Chromosome.,5,Lukasz Huminiecki,Laurence D Hurst,"[Laurence D Hurst, Avazeh T Ghanbarian, Alistair R R Forrest, Lukasz Huminiecki]","[The Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom, Center for Life Science Technologies (CLST), Yokohama, Japan, None, The Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden]"

This regulation requires components of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure formed between homologous chromosomes. In yeast, SC formation requires the ""ZMM"" genes, which encode a functionally diverse set of proteins, including the transverse filament protein, Zip1. In wild-type meiosis, Zmm proteins promote the biased resolution of recombination intermediates into crossovers that are distributed throughout the genome by interference. In contrast, noncrossovers are formed primarily through synthesis-dependent strand annealing mediated by the Sgs1 helicase. This work identifies a conserved region on the C terminus of Zip1 (called Zip1 4S), whose phosphorylation is required for the ZMM pathway of crossover formation. Zip1 4S phosphorylation is promoted both by double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the meiosis-specific kinase, MEK1/MRE4, demonstrating a role for MEK1 in the regulation of interhomolog crossover formation, as well as interhomolog bias. Failure to phosphorylate Zip1 4S results in meiotic prophase arrest, specifically in the absence of SGS1. This gain of function meiotic arrest phenotype is suppressed by spo11\u0394, suggesting that it is due to unrepaired breaks triggering the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Epistasis experiments combining deletions of individual ZMM genes with sgs1-md zip1-4A indicate that Zip1 4S phosphorylation functions prior to the other ZMMs. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Zip1 at DSBs commits those breaks to repair via the ZMM pathway and provides a mechanism by which the crossover/noncrossover decision can be dynamically regulated during yeast meiosis.']",Phosphorylation of the Synaptonemal Complex Protein Zip1 Regulates the Crossover/Noncrossover Decision during Yeast Meiosis.,12,Nancy M Hollingsworth,Xiangyu Chen,"[Xiangyu Chen, Ray T Suhandynata, Rima Sandhu, Beth Rockmill, Neeman Mohibullah, Hengyao Niu, Jason Liang, Hsiao-Chi Lo, Danny E Miller, Huilin Zhou, G Valentin Börner, Nancy M Hollingsworth]","[Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, United States of America, Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease and Department of Biological Sciences, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America, Molecular Biology Program, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, United States of America, Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America, Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri, United States of America]"

TGF-\u03b2 also activates the Erk MAPK pathway through recruitment and Tyr phosphorylation of the adaptor protein ShcA by the activated TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor. We found that ShcA protects the epithelial integrity of nontransformed cells against EMT by repressing TGF-\u03b2-induced, Smad-mediated gene expression. p52ShcA competed with Smad3 for TGF-\u03b2 receptor binding, and down-regulation of ShcA expression enhanced autocrine TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling and target gene expression, whereas increased p52ShcA expression resulted in decreased Smad3 binding to the TGF-\u03b2 receptor, decreased Smad3 activation, and increased Erk MAPK and Akt signaling. Furthermore, p52ShcA sequestered TGF-\u03b2 receptor complexes to caveolin-associated membrane compartments, and reducing ShcA expression enhanced the receptor localization in clathrin-associated membrane compartments that enable Smad activation. Consequently, silencing ShcA expression induced EMT, with increased cell migration, invasion, and dissemination, and increased stem cell generation and mammosphere formation, dependent upon autocrine TGF-\u03b2 signaling.

By combining electrical recordings, Ca2+ and Na+ imaging, and realistic computational modeling, we explored the mechanisms underlying the persistent activity in AOB mitral cells.

In the fly, the parasite's surface is covered with invariant procyclin, while in the mammal it resides extracellularly in its bloodstream form (BF) and is densely covered with highly immunogenic Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). In the BF, the parasite varies this highly immunogenic surface VSG using a repertoire of ~2500 distinct VSG genes. Recent reports in mammalian systems point to a role for histone acetyl-lysine recognizing bromodomain proteins in the maintenance of stem cell fate, leading us to hypothesize that bromodomain proteins may maintain the BF cell fate in trypanosomes. Using small-molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants for individual bromodomain proteins, we performed RNA-seq experiments that revealed changes in the transcriptome similar to those seen in cells differentiating from the BF to the insect stage. This was recapitulated at the protein level by the appearance of insect-stage proteins on the cell surface. Furthermore, bromodomain inhibition disrupts two major BF-specific immune evasion mechanisms that trypanosomes harness to evade mammalian host antibody responses. First, monoallelic expression of the antigenically varied VSG is disrupted. Second, rapid internalization of antibodies bound to VSG on the surface of the trypanosome is blocked. Thus, our studies reveal a role for trypanosome bromodomain proteins in maintaining bloodstream stage identity and immune evasion. Importantly, bromodomain inhibition leads to a decrease in virulence in a mouse model of infection, establishing these proteins as potential therapeutic drug targets for trypanosomiasis.

While CBD-A in RI\u03b1 is required for PKA inhibition and activation, CBD-B functions as a ""gatekeeper"" domain that modulates the control exerted by CBD-A. Preliminary evidence suggests that CBD-B dynamics are critical for its gatekeeper function. To test this hypothesis, here we investigate by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) the two-domain construct RI\u03b1 (91-379) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms.

Such degeneracy is critical to explain the sensitivity of CBD-B to weak interactions with C and its high affinity for cAMP. Binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, as it selectively stabilizes the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and W260. The latter is contributed by CBD-B and mediates capping of the cAMP bound to CBD-A. The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformational selection, but is indispensable for full activation of PKA as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. In addition, the two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles, supporting the notion that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics.']",Mapping the Free Energy Landscape of PKA Inhibition and Activation: A Double-Conformational Selection Model for the Tandem cAMP-Binding Domains of PKA RIα.,6,Giuseppe Melacini,Madoka Akimoto,"[Madoka Akimoto, Eric Tyler McNicholl, Avinash Ramkissoon, Kody Moleschi, Susan S Taylor, Giuseppe Melacini]","[Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Department of Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America]"

We identified that RNA targets of Puf3 orthologs have been conserved over 100-500 million years of evolution in five eukaryotic lineages. Focusing on Puf proteins and their targets across 80 fungi, we constructed a parsimonious model for their evolutionary history. This model entails extensive and coordinated changes in the Puf targets as well as changes in the number of Puf genes and alterations of RNA binding specificity including that: 1) Binding of Puf3 to more than 200 RNAs whose protein products are predominantly involved in the production and organization of mitochondrial complexes predates the origin of budding yeasts and filamentous fungi and was maintained for 500 million years, throughout the evolution of budding yeast. 2) In filamentous fungi, remarkably, more than 150 of the ancestral Puf3 targets were gained by Puf4, with one lineage maintaining both Puf3 and Puf4 as regulators and a sister lineage losing Puf3 as a regulator of these RNAs. The decrease in gene expression of these mRNAs upon deletion of Puf4 in filamentous fungi (N. crassa) in contrast to the increase upon Puf3 deletion in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) suggests that the output of the RNA regulatory network is different with Puf4 in filamentous fungi than with Puf3 in budding yeast. 3) The coregulated Puf4 target set in filamentous fungi expanded to include mitochondrial genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and other nuclear-encoded RNAs with mitochondrial function not bound by Puf3 in budding yeast, observations that provide additional evidence for substantial rewiring of post-transcriptional regulation. 4) Puf3 also expanded and diversified its targets in filamentous fungi, gaining interactions with the mRNAs encoding the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I as well as hundreds of other mRNAs with nonmitochondrial functions. The many concerted and conserved changes in the RNA targets of Puf proteins strongly support an extensive role of RNA binding proteins in coordinating gene expression, as originally proposed by Keene. Rewiring of Puf-coordinated mRNA targets and transcriptional control of the same genes occurred at different points in evolution, suggesting that there have been distinct adaptations via RNA binding proteins and transcription factors. The changes in Puf targets and in the Puf proteins indicate an integral involvement of RNA binding proteins and their RNA targets in the adaptation, reprogramming, and function of gene expression.""]",Evolutionary Conservation and Diversification of Puf RNA Binding Proteins and Their mRNA Targets.,3,Daniel Herschlag,Gregory J Hogan,"[Gregory J Hogan, Patrick O Brown, Daniel Herschlag]","[Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America]"

It is a long-standing goal to predict rates of resistance evolution and design optimal treatment strategies accordingly. To this end, it is crucial to reveal the underlying causes of drug-specific differences in the evolutionary dynamics leading to resistance. However, it remains largely unknown why the rates of resistance evolution via spontaneous mutations and the diversity of mutational paths vary substantially between drugs. Here we comprehensively quantify the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations, a key determinant of evolutionary dynamics, in the presence of eight antibiotics representing the main modes of action. Using precise high-throughput fitness measurements for genome-wide Escherichia coli gene deletion strains, we find that the width of the DFE varies dramatically between antibiotics and, contrary to conventional wisdom, for some drugs the DFE width is lower than in the absence of stress. We show that this previously underappreciated divergence in DFE width among antibiotics is largely caused by their distinct drug-specific dose-response characteristics. Unlike the DFE, the magnitude of the changes in tolerated drug concentration resulting from genome-wide mutations is similar for most drugs but exceptionally small for the antibiotic nitrofurantoin, i.e., mutations generally have considerably smaller resistance effects for nitrofurantoin than for other drugs. A population genetics model predicts that resistance evolution for drugs with this property is severely limited and confined to reproducible mutational paths. We tested this prediction in laboratory evolution experiments using the ""morbidostat"", a device for evolving bacteria in well-controlled drug environments. Nitrofurantoin resistance indeed evolved extremely slowly via reproducible mutations-an almost paradoxical behavior since this drug causes DNA damage and increases the mutation rate. Overall, we identified novel quantitative characteristics of the evolutionary landscape that provide the conceptual foundation for predicting the dynamics of drug resistance evolution.']",Quantifying the Determinants of Evolutionary Dynamics Leading to Drug Resistance.,7,Tobias Bollenbach,Guillaume Chevereau,"[Guillaume Chevereau, Marta Dravecká, Tugce Batur, Aysegul Guvenek, Dilay Hazal Ayhan, Erdal Toprak, Tobias Bollenbach]","[IST Austria, Am Campus 1, Klosterneuburg, Austria, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey]"

Bats have evolved an impressive capacity to control their flight, in large part due to their ability to modulate wing shape, area, and angle of attack through many independently controlled joints. Bat wings, however, also contain many bones and relatively large muscles, and thus the ratio of bats' wing mass to their body mass is larger than it is for all other extant flyers. Although the inertia in bat wings would typically be associated with decreased aerial maneuverability, we show that bat maneuvers challenge this notion. We use a model-based tracking algorithm to measure the wing and body kinematics of bats performing complex aerial rotations. Using a minimal model of a bat with only six degrees of kinematic freedom, we show that bats can perform body rolls by selectively retracting one wing during the flapping cycle. We also show that this maneuver does not rely on aerodynamic forces, and furthermore that a fruit fly, with nearly massless wings, would not exhibit this effect. Similar results are shown for a pitching maneuver. Finally, we combine high-resolution kinematics of wing and body movements during landing and falling maneuvers with a 52-degree-of-freedom dynamical model of a bat to show that modulation of wing inertia plays the dominant role in reorienting the bat during landing and falling maneuvers, with minimal contribution from aerodynamic forces. Bats can, therefore, use their wings as multifunctional organs, capable of sophisticated aerodynamic and inertial dynamics not previously observed in other flying animals.

Here we address the role of the latter during axis extension, using Drosophila germband extension (GBE) as a model. We found previously that cells elongate in the anteroposterior (AP) axis in the extending germband, suggesting that an extrinsic tensile force contributed to body axis extension. Here we further characterized the AP cell elongation patterns during GBE, by tracking cells and quantifying their apical cell deformation over time. AP cell elongation forms a gradient culminating at the posterior of the embryo, consistent with an AP-oriented tensile force propagating from there. To identify the morphogenetic movements that could be the source of this extrinsic force, we mapped gastrulation movements temporally using light sheet microscopy to image whole Drosophila embryos. We found that both mesoderm and endoderm invaginations are synchronous with the onset of GBE. The AP cell elongation gradient remains when mesoderm invagination is blocked but is abolished in the absence of endoderm invagination. This suggested that endoderm invagination is the source of the tensile force. We next looked for evidence of this force in a simplified system without polarized cell intercalation, in acellular embryos. Using Particle Image Velocimetry, we identify posteriorwards Myosin II flows towards the presumptive posterior endoderm, which still undergoes apical constriction in acellular embryos as in wildtype. We probed this posterior region using laser ablation and showed that tension is increased in the AP orientation, compared to dorsoventral orientation or to either orientations more anteriorly in the embryo.

To investigate how organisms mitigate the deleterious effects of protein synthesis errors during evolution, a mutant yeast strain was engineered to translate a codon ambiguously (mistranslation). It thereby overloads the protein quality-control pathways and disrupts cellular protein homeostasis. This strain was used to study the capacity of the yeast genome to compensate the deleterious effects of protein mistranslation. Laboratory evolutionary experiments revealed that fitness loss due to mistranslation can rapidly be mitigated. Genomic analysis demonstrated that adaptation was primarily mediated by large-scale chromosomal duplication and deletion events, suggesting that errors during protein synthesis promote the evolution of genome architecture. By altering the dosages of numerous, functionally related proteins simultaneously, these genetic changes introduced large phenotypic leaps that enabled rapid adaptation to mistranslation. Evolution increased the level of tolerance to mistranslation through acceleration of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradation and protein synthesis. As a consequence of rapid elimination of erroneous protein products, evolution reduced the extent of toxic protein aggregation in mistranslating cells. However, there was a strong evolutionary trade-off between adaptation to mistranslation and survival upon starvation: the evolved lines showed fitness defects and impaired capacity to degrade mature ribosomes upon nutrient limitation. Moreover, as a response to an enhanced energy demand of accelerated protein turnover, the evolved lines exhibited increased glucose uptake by selective duplication of hexose transporter genes. We conclude that adjustment of proteome homeostasis to mistranslation evolves rapidly, but this adaptation has several side effects on cellular physiology.

Neurovascular decline was sufficient to cause vascular leakage and correlated strongly with an increase in neuroinflammation including up-regulation of complement component C1QA in microglia/monocytes. Importantly, long-term aerobic exercise from midlife to old age prevented this age-related neurovascular decline, reduced C1QA+ microglia/monocytes, and increased synaptic plasticity and overall behavioral capabilities of aged mice. Concomitant with age-related neurovascular decline and complement activation, astrocytic Apoe dramatically decreased in aged mice, a decrease that was prevented by exercise. Given the role of APOE in maintaining the neurovascular unit and as an anti-inflammatory molecule, this suggests a possible link between astrocytic Apoe, age-related neurovascular dysfunction and microglia/monocyte activation. To test this, Apoe-deficient mice were exercised from midlife to old age and in contrast to wild-type (Apoe-sufficient) mice, exercise had little to no effect on age-related neurovascular decline or microglia/monocyte activation in the absence of APOE.

Here we investigate the impacts of future climates on a model vertebrate ectotherm species using a large-scale warming experiment. We manipulated climatic conditions in 18 seminatural populations over two years to obtain a present climate treatment and a warm climate treatment matching IPCC predictions for future climate. Warmer temperatures caused a faster body growth, an earlier reproductive onset, and an increased voltinism, leading to a highly accelerated life cycle but also to a decrease in adult survival. A matrix population model predicts that warm climate populations in our experiment should go extinct in around 20 y. Comparing our experimental climatic conditions to conditions encountered by populations across Europe, we suggest that warming climates should threaten a significant number of populations at the southern range of the distribution. Our findings stress the importance of experimental approaches on the entire life cycle to more accurately predict population and species persistence in future climates.""]","Live Fast, Die Young: Experimental Evidence of Population Extinction Risk due to Climate Change.",5,Julien Cote,Elvire Bestion,"[Elvire Bestion, Aimeric Teyssier, Murielle Richard, Jean Clobert, Julien Cote]","[CNRS USR 2936, Station d'Ecologie Expérimentale de Moulis, Moulis, France; CNRS, Université Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, ENFA; UMR5174 EDB (Laboratoire Évolution & Diversité Biologique), Toulouse, France; Environmental and Sustainability Institute, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn, United Kingdom, CNRS, Université Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, ENFA; UMR5174 EDB (Laboratoire Évolution & Diversité Biologique), Toulouse, France; Terrestrial Ecology Unit, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, CNRS USR 2936, Station d'Ecologie Expérimentale de Moulis, Moulis, France, CNRS, Université Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, ENFA; UMR5174 EDB (Laboratoire Évolution & Diversité Biologique), Toulouse, France]"

The transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki, a YES-Associated Protein, or YAP) acts downstream of patterning morphogens and other tissue-intrinsic signals to promote organ growth. Yki activity is regulated primarily by the Warts/Hippo (Wts/Hpo) tumour suppressor pathway, which impedes nuclear access of Yki by a cytoplasmic tethering mechanism. Here, we show that the TOR pathway regulates Yki by a separate and novel mechanism in the Drosophila wing. Instead of controlling Yki nuclear access, TOR signaling governs Yki action after it reaches the nucleus by allowing it to gain access to its target genes. When TOR activity is inhibited, Yki accumulates in the nucleus but is sequestered from its normal growth-promoting target genes--a phenomenon we term ""nuclear seclusion."" Hence, we posit that in addition to its well-known role in stimulating cellular metabolism in response to nutrients, TOR also promotes wing growth by liberating Yki from nuclear seclusion, a parallel pathway that we propose contributes to the scaling of wing size with nutrient availability.']",Scaling the Drosophila Wing: TOR-Dependent Target Gene Access by the Hippo Pathway Transducer Yorkie.,2,Gary Struhl,Joseph Parker,"[Joseph Parker, Gary Struhl]","[Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America; Division of Biology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America]"

Using mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq), we show that unconventional Xbp1 mRNA splicing is required to increase and decrease the expression of several hundred mRNAs encoding functions that expand the protein secretory capacity for increased insulin production and protect from oxidative damage, respectively. At 2 wk after tamoxifen-mediated Ire1\u03b1 deletion, mice develop hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, due to defective \u03b2 cell function that was exacerbated upon feeding and glucose stimulation.

Instead, \u03b2 cell failure upon Ire1\u03b1 deletion was primarily due to reduced proinsulin mRNA translation primarily because of defective glucose-stimulated induction of a dozen genes required for the signal recognition particle (SRP), SRP receptors, the translocon, the signal peptidase complex, and over 100 other genes with many other intracellular functions. In contrast, Ire1\u03b1 deletion in \u03b2 cells increased the expression of over 300 mRNAs encoding functions that cause inflammation and oxidative stress, yet only a few of these accumulated during high glucose. Antioxidant treatment significantly reduced glucose intolerance and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in mice with \u03b2 cell-specific Ire1\u03b1 deletion.

Passive cochlear mechanics is based on physical and geometrical properties of the cochlea and the fluid-tissue interaction between the cochlear partition and the surrounding fluid. Although the fluid-tissue interaction between the basilar membrane and the fluid in scala tympani (ST) has been explored in both active and passive cochleae, there was no experimental data on the fluid-tissue interaction on the scala media (SM) side of the partition. To this aim, we measured sound-evoked intracochlear pressure in SM close to the partition using micropressure sensors. All the SM pressure data are from passive cochleae, likely because the SM cochleostomy led to loss of endocochlear potential. Thus, these experiments are studies of passive cochlear mechanics. SM pressure close to the tissue showed a pattern of peaks and notches, which could be explained as an interaction between fast and slow (i.e., traveling wave) pressure modes. In several animals SM and ST pressure were measured in the same cochlea. Similar to previous studies, ST-pressure was dominated by a slow, traveling wave mode at stimulus frequencies in the vicinity of the best frequency of the measurement location, and by a fast mode above best frequency. Antisymmetric pressure between SM and ST supported the classic single-partition cochlear models, or a dual-partition model with tight coupling between partitions. From the SM and ST pressure we calculated slow and fast modes, and from active ST pressure we extrapolated the passive findings to the active case. The passive slow mode estimated from SM and ST data was low-pass in nature, as predicted by cochlear models.']",Intracochlear Scala Media Pressure Measurement: Implications for Models of Cochlear Mechanics.,2,Elizabeth S Olson,Sushrut S Kale,"[Sushrut S Kale, Elizabeth S Olson]","[Department of Otolaryngology, Columbia University, New York, New York, Electronic address:, Department of Otolaryngology, Columbia University, New York, New York; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York]"

The native-state hydrogen-exchange data suggest that the six-stranded \u03b2-barrel core of the I-domain is more stable against unfolding than a smaller subdomain comprised of a short \u03b1-helix and three-stranded \u03b2-sheet. H-bonds, separately determined from solvent protection and (3)JNC' H-bond couplings, are identified with an accuracy of 90% by (1)HN temperature coefficients. The accuracy is improved to 95% when (15)N temperature coefficients are also included. In contrast, the urea dependence of (1)HN and (15)N chemical shifts is unrelated to H-bonding. The protein segments with the largest chemical-shift changes in the presence of urea show curved or sigmoidal titration curves suggestive of direct urea binding. Nuclear Overhauser effects to urea for these segments are also consistent with specific urea-binding sites in the I-domain. Taken together, the results support a mechanism of urea unfolding in which denaturant binds to distinct sites in the I-domain. Disordered segments bind urea more readily than regions in stable secondary structure. The locations of the putative urea-binding sites correlate with the lower stability of the structure against solvent exchange, suggesting that partial unfolding of the structure is related to urea accessibility.""]",Mechanism of Protein Denaturation: Partial Unfolding of the P22 Coat Protein I-Domain by Urea Binding.,4,Andrei T Alexandrescu,Rebecca L Newcomer,"[Rebecca L Newcomer, LaTasha C R Fraser, Carolyn M Teschke, Andrei T Alexandrescu]","[Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut; Department of Chemistry, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, Electronic address:]"

More recently, similar gene regulation mechanisms have been found to be important for viral systems as well. One of the most abundant and best-studied systems is the tRNA-like structure (TLS) domain, which has been found to occur in many plant viruses spread across numerous genera. In this work, folding dynamics for the TLS domain of Brome Mosaic Virus have been investigated using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques. In particular, burst fluorescence methods are exploited to observe metal-ion ([M(n+)])-induced folding in freely diffusing RNA constructs resembling the minimal TLS element of brome mosaic virus RNA3. The results of these experiments reveal a complex equilibrium of at least three distinct populations. A stepwise, or consecutive, thermodynamic model for TLS folding is developed, which is in good agreement with the [M(n+)]-dependent evolution of conformational populations and existing structural information in the literature. Specifically, this folding pathway explains the metal-ion dependent formation of a functional TLS domain from unfolded RNAs via two consecutive steps: 1) hybridization of a long-range stem interaction, followed by 2) formation of a 3'-terminal pseudoknot. These two conformational transitions are well described by stepwise dissociation constants for [Mg(2+)] (K1\xa0= 328 \xb1 30 \u03bcM and K2\xa0= 1092 \xb1 183 \u03bcM) and [Na(+)] (K1\xa0= 74 \xb1 6\xa0mM and K2\xa0= 243 \xb1 52\xa0mM)-induced folding.

This process is facilitated by soluble, biogenic flavins secreted by the organism for the purpose of acting as an electron shuttle. However, their interactions with the outer-membrane cytochromes are not established on a molecular scale.

Molecular dynamics simulation gives indications for a possible conformational switch upon cleavage of the disulphide bond of MtrC, but without concomitant increase in binding affinities according to this docking study.

VSPs thus couple two signaling pathways that are critical for cellular functioning. Although a number of nonmammalian VSPs have been characterized biophysically, mammalian VSPs are less well understood at both the physiological and biophysical levels. In this study, we aimed to address this gap in knowledge by determining whether the VSP from mouse, Mm-VSP, is expressed in the brain and contains a functional voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a phosphatase domain. We report that Mm-VSP is expressed in neurons and is developmentally regulated. To address whether the functions of the VSD and phosphatase domain are retained in Mm-VSP, we took advantage of the modular nature of these domains and expressed each independently as a chimeric protein in a heterologous expression system. We found that the Mm-VSP VSD, fused to a viral potassium channel, was able to drive voltage-dependent gating of the channel pore. The Mm-VSP phosphatase domain, fused to the VSD of a nonmammalian VSP, was also functional: activation resulted in PI(4,5)P2 depletion that was sufficient to inhibit the PI(4,5)P2-regulated KCNQ2/3 channels. While testing the functionality of the VSD and phosphatase domain, we observed slight differences between the activities of Mm-VSP-based chimeras and those of nonmammalian VSPs. Although the properties of VSP chimeras may not completely reflect the properties of native VSPs, the differences we observed in voltage-sensing and phosphatase activity provide a starting point for future experiments to investigate the function of Mm-VSP and other mammalian VSPs. In conclusion, our data reveal that both the VSD and the lipid phosphatase domain of Mm-VSP are functional, indicating that Mm-VSP likely plays an important role in mouse neurophysiology.']",Characterization of the Functional Domains of a Mammalian Voltage-Sensitive Phosphatase.,3,Sandra M Bajjalieh,Mario G Rosasco,"[Mario G Rosasco, Sharona E Gordon, Sandra M Bajjalieh]","[Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, Electronic address:]"

Here, we study the mechanics of liposomes or giant unilamellar vesicles, when a biomimetic actin cortex is grown at the inner layer of the lipid membrane via actin-nucleation-promoting factors. Using a hydrodynamic tube-pulling technique, we show that tube dynamics is clearly affected by the presence of an actin shell anchored to the lipid bilayer. The same force pulls much shorter tubes in the presence of the actin shell compared to bare membranes. However, in both cases, we observe that the dynamics of tube extrusion has two distinct features characteristic of viscoelastic materials: rapid elastic elongation, followed by a slower elongation phase at a constant rate. We interpret the initial elastic regime by an increase of membrane tension due to the loss of lipids into the tube. Tube length is considerably shorter for cortex liposomes at comparable pulling forces, resulting in a higher spring constant. The presence of the actin shell seems to restrict lipid mobility, as is observed in the corral effect in cells. The viscous regime for bare liposomes corresponds to a leakout of the internal liquid at constant membrane tension. The presence of the actin shell leads to a larger friction coefficient. As the tube is pulled from a patchy surface, membrane tension increases locally, leading to a Marangoni flow of lipids. As a conclusion, the presence of an actin shell is revealed by its action that alters membrane mechanics.']",Mechanics of Biomimetic Liposomes Encapsulating an Actin Shell.,5,Cécile Sykes,Karine Guevorkian,"[Karine Guevorkian, John Manzi, Léa-Lætitia Pontani, Françoise Brochard-Wyart, Cécile Sykes]","[Laboratoire Physico Chimie Curie, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR168, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Université de Strasbourg, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR 7104, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France, Laboratoire Physico Chimie Curie, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR168, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Paris, France, Institut des Nanosciences de Paris, Université Paris VI, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR 7588, Paris, France, Electronic address:]"

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is activated at unattached and misattached kinetochores to prevent further mitotic progression. The SAC is silenced after all the kinetochores establish proper and stable attachment to the spindle. Robust timing of SAC silencing after the last kinetochore-spindle attachment herein dictates the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Chromosome missegregation is rare in typical somatic cell mitosis, but frequent in cancer cell mitosis and in meiosis I of mammalian oocytes. In the latter cases, SAC is normally activated in response to disruptions of kinetochore-spindle attachments, suggesting that frequent chromosome missegregation ensues from faulty SAC silencing. In-depth understanding of how SAC silencing malfunctions in these cases is yet missing, but is believed to hold promise for treatment of cancer and prevention of human miscarriage and birth defects. We previously established a spatiotemporal model that, to the best of our knowledge, explained the robustness of SAC silencing in normal mitosis for the first time. In this article, we take advantage of the whole-cell perspective of the spatiotemporal model to identify possible causes of chromosome missegregation out of the distinct features of spindle assembly exhibited by cancer cells and mammalian oocytes. The model results explain why multipolar spindle could inhibit SAC silencing and spindle pole clustering could promote it-albeit accompanied by more kinetochore attachment errors. The model also eliminates geometric factors as the cause for nonrobust SAC silencing in oocyte meiosis, and instead, suggests atypical kinetochore-spindle attachment in meiosis as a potential culprit. Overall, the model shows that abnormal spindle-pole formation and its aberrant coordination with atypical kinetochore-spindle attachments could compromise the robustness of SAC silencing. Our model highlights systems-level coupling between kinetochore-spindle attachment and spindle-pole formation in SAC silencing.']",Erroneous Silencing of the Mitotic Checkpoint by Aberrant Spindle Pole-Kinetochore Coordination.,2,Jian Liu,Jing Chen,"[Jing Chen, Jian Liu]","[National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, Electronic address:]"

Meanwhile, the purse strings act as contractile elastic rods bent toward the embryo interior near each canthus. We propose that a canthus-localized force contributes to both bending the ends of the purse strings and the formation of lateral junctions. We developed a thermodynamic model for zipping based on three-dimensional remodeling of the tissue interfaces and the reaction dynamics of adhesion molecules in junctions and elsewhere, which we applied to zipping during unperturbed wild-type closure and to laser or genetically perturbed closure.

Experimental studies have shown that although axons can tolerate 100% strain under slow loading rates, even strain as small as 5% can rupture microtubules (MTs) during the fast loading velocities relevant to TBI. Here, we developed a computational model to examine rate-dependent behavior related to dynamic interactions between MTs and the MT-associated protein tau under varying strains and strain rates. In the model, inverted pairs of tau proteins can dynamically cross-link parallel MTs via the respective MT-binding domain of each tau. The model also incorporates realistic thermodynamic breaking and reformation of the bonds between the connected tau proteins as they respond to mechanical stretch. With simulated stretch of the axon, the model shows that despite the highly dynamic nature of binding and unbinding events, under fast loading rates relevant to TBI, large tensile forces can be transmitted to the MTs that can lead to mechanical rupture of the MT cylinder, in agreement with experimental observations and as inferred in human TBI. In contrast, at slow loading rates, the progressive breaking and reformation of the bonds between the tau proteins facilitate the extension of axons up to \u223c100% strain without any microstructural damage. The model also predicts that under fast loading rates, individual MTs detach from MT bundles via sequential breaking of the tau-tau bonds. Finally, the model demonstrates that longer MTs are more susceptible to mechanical rupture, whereas short MTs are more prone to detachment from the MT bundle, leading to disintegration of the axonal MT ultrastructure.

In this work, the structural organization of membranes in LBs and LBPs freshly secreted by primary cultures of rat ATII cells has been compared with that of native lung surfactant membranes isolated from porcine bronchoalveolar lavage. PS assembles in LBs as crystalline-like highly ordered structures, with a highly packed and dehydrated state, which is maintained at supraphysiological temperatures. This relatively ordered/packed state is retained in secreted LBPs. The micro- and nanostructural examination of LBPs suggests the existence of high levels of structural complexity in comparison with the material purified from lavages, which may contain partially inactivated or spent structures. Additionally, freshly secreted surfactant LBPs exhibit superior activity when generating interfacial films and a higher intrinsic resistance to inactivating agents, such as serum proteins or meconium.

During a membrane depolarization movement, the S4s in the voltage-sensor domains exert downstream effects on the S6 segments to control ionic conductance through the pore domain. We used lidocaine, a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic drug, to probe the role of conserved Asn residues in the S6s of DIII and DIV in NaV1.5 and NaV1.4. Previous studies have shown that lidocaine binding to the pore domain causes a decrease in the maximum gating (Qmax) charge of \u223c38%, and three-fourths of this decrease results from the complete stabilization of DIII-S4 (contributing a 30% reduction in Qmax) and one-fourth is due to partial stabilization of DIV-S4 (a reduction of 8-10%). Even though substitutions for the Asn in DIV-S6 in NaV1.5, N1764A and N1764C, produce little ionic current in transfected mammalian cells, they both express robust gating currents. Anthopleurin-A toxin, which inhibits movement of DIV-S4, still reduced Qmax by nearly 30%, a value similar to that observed in wild-type channels, in both N1764A and N1764C. By applying lidocaine and measuring the gating currents, we demonstrated that Asn residues in the S6s of DIII and DIV are important for coupling their pore domains to their voltage-sensor domains, and that Ala and Cys substitutions for Asn in both S6s result in uncoupling of the pore domains from their voltage-sensor domains. Similar observations were made for NaV1.4, although substitutions for Asn in DIII-S6 showed somewhat less uncoupling.""]",Important Role of Asparagines in Coupling the Pore and Votage-Sensor Domain in Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels.,3,Dorothy A Hanck,Michael F Sheets,"[Michael F Sheets, Harry A Fozzard, Dorothy A Hanck]","[Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute (CVRTI), University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, Electronic address:, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]"

The rational design of all these applications requires the characterization of the nanoparticles intracellular trafficking pathways. In this work, we exploit live-cell time-lapse confocal reflectance microscopy and image correlation in both direct and reciprocal space to investigate the intracellular transport of branched gold nanostars (GNSs). Different transport mechanisms, spanning from pure Brownian diffusion to (sub-)ballistic superdiffusion, are revealed by temporal and spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy on the tens-of-seconds timescale. According to these findings, combined with numerical simulations and with a Bayesian (hidden Markov model-based) analysis of single particle tracking data, we ascribe the superdiffusive, subballistic behavior characterizing the GNSs dynamics to a two-state switching between Brownian diffusion in the cytoplasm and molecular motor-mediated active transport. For the investigation of intermittent-type transport phenomena, we derive an analytical theoretical framework for Fourier-space image correlation spectroscopy (kICS). At first, we evaluate the influence of all the dynamic and kinetic parameters (the diffusion coefficient, the drift velocity, and the transition rates between the diffusive and the active transport regimes) on simulated kICS correlation functions. Then we outline a protocol for data analysis and employ it to derive whole-cell maps for each parameter underlying the GNSs intracellular dynamics. Capable of identifying even simpler transport phenomena, whether purely diffusive or ballistic, our intermittent kICS approach allows an exhaustive investigation of the dynamics of GNSs and biological macromolecules.']",An Intermittent Model for Intracellular Motions of Gold Nanostars by k-Space Scattering Image Correlation.,7,Maddalena Collini,Margaux Bouzin,"[Margaux Bouzin, Laura Sironi, Giuseppe Chirico, Laura D'Alfonso, Donato Inverso, Piersandro Pallavicini, Maddalena Collini]","[Physics Department, Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, Chemistry Department, Università degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy, Electronic address:]"

Mechanical deformation causes disassembly of the cytoskeleton and a sudden drop of the elastic modulus of the neutrophil. This fluidization is followed by either activation of the neutrophil with protrusion of pseudopods or a uniform recovery of the cytoskeleton network with no pseudopod. The former occurs if the neutrophil traverses the narrow channel at a slower rate. We propose a chemo-mechanical model for the fluidization and activation processes. Fluidization is treated as mechanical destruction of the cytoskeleton by sufficiently rapid bending. Loss of the cytoskeleton removes a pathway by which cortical tension inhibits the Rac protein. As a result, Rac rises and polarizes through a wave-pinning mechanism if the chemical reaction rate is fast enough. This leads to recovery and reinforcement of the cytoskeleton at the front of the neutrophil, and hence protrusion and activation. Otherwise the Rac signal returns to a uniform pre-deformation state and no activation occurs. Thus, mechanically induced neutrophil activation is understood as the competition between two timescales: that of chemical reaction and that of mechanical deformation.

Liquid organelles formed by intracellular phase coexistence could provide an additional means of sequential enzyme colocalization. Here we use experiment and computation to explore the kinetic consequences of sequential enzyme compartmentalization into model liquid organelles in a crowded polymer solution. Two proteins of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, ASL (adenylosuccinate lyase, Step 8) and ATIC (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase, Steps 9 and 10), were studied in a polyethylene glycol/dextran aqueous two-phase system.

The purpose of this study was to investigate CIA using computational analysis. We added a structurally motivated representation of this phenomenon to an existing myofilament model, which allowed predictions of CIA-dependent muscle behavior. We found that a certain amount of CIA was essential for the model to reproduce reported effects of nonfunctional troponin C on myofilament force generation. Consequently, those data enabled estimation of \u0394GCIA, the energy barrier for activating a thin filament regulatory unit in the absence of Ca2+. Using this estimate of \u0394GCIA as a point of reference (\u223c7 kJ mol(-1)), we examined its impact on various aspects of muscle function through additional simulations. CIA decreased the Hill coefficient of steady-state force while increasing myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. At the same time, CIA had minimal effect on the rate of force redevelopment after slack/restretch. Simulations of twitch tension show that the presence of CIA increases peak tension while profoundly delaying relaxation. We tested the model's ability to represent perturbations to the Ca2+ regulatory mechanism by analyzing twitch records measured in transgenic mice expressing a cardiac troponin I mutation (R145G). The effects of the mutation on twitch dynamics were fully reproduced by a single parameter change, namely lowering \u0394GCIA by 2.3 kJ mol(-1) relative to its wild-type value.

Interestingly, PG increased SF activity and changed its leakage mechanism toward all-or-none, suggesting more specific, larger, and/or longer-lived defect structures. This may be because of the reduced energetic cost of locally accumulating anionic SF in an anionic lipid matrix. IT was found largely inactive in our assays. B.\xa0subtilis QST713 produces the lipopeptides in a ratio of 6\xa0mol SF: 37\xa0mol FE: 57\xa0mol IT. Leakage induced by this native mixture was inhibited by CHOL and PE, but unaffected by ERG and by PG in the absence of PE. Note that fungi contain anionic lipids, but little PE.

The increase in Ca2+ spark rate is thought to be due to an increase in ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) open probability by direct oxidation of the RyR2 protein complex. In this article, a computational model is used to examine the regulation of ROS and calcium homeostasis by local, subcellular X-ROS signaling and its role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. To this end, a four-state RyR2 model was developed that includes an X-ROS-dependent RyR2 mode switch. When activated, [Ca2+]i-sensitive RyR2 open probability increases, and the Ca2+ spark rate changes in a manner consistent with experimental observations. This, to our knowledge, new model is used to study the transient effects of diastolic stretching and subsequent ROS production on RyR2 open probability, Ca2+ sparks, and the myoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) during excitation-contraction coupling. The model yields several predictions: 1) [ROS] is produced locally near the RyR2 complex during X-ROS signaling and increases by an order of magnitude more than the global ROS signal during myocyte stretching; 2) X-ROS activation just before the action potential, corresponding to ventricular filling during diastole, increases the magnitude of the Ca2+ transient; 3) during prolonged stretching, the X-ROS-induced increase in Ca2+ spark rate is transient, so that long-sustained stretching does not significantly increase sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak; and 4) when the chemical reducing capacity of the cell is decreased, activation of X-ROS signaling increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and contributes to global oxidative stress, thereby increases the possibility of arrhythmia.

If it is cooled extremely rapidly, liquid water turns into amorphous ice, also called vitreous water, a glassy and amorphous solid. For cryo-preservation, the vitrification of cells is believed to be mandatory for cell survival after freezing. Intracellular ice crystallization is assumed to be lethal, but experimental data on the state of water during cryopreservation are lacking. To better understand the water conditions in cells subjected to freezing protocols, we chose to directly analyze their subcellular water states by cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, cryoelectron diffraction, and x-ray diffraction both in the cryofixed state and after warming to different temperatures. By correlating the survival rates of cells with their respective water states during cryopreservation, we found that survival is less dependent on ice-crystal formation than expected. Using high-resolution cryo-imaging, we were able to directly show that cells tolerate crystallization of extra- and intracellular water. However, if warming is too slow, many small ice crystals will recrystallize into fewer but bigger crystals, which is lethal.

Large-scale x-ray sources, such as synchrotrons and x-ray free electron lasers, are becoming ever brighter and make the study of such weakly scattering materials more feasible. Variants of coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) are particularly attractive, as the absence of an objective lens between sample and detector ensures that no x-ray photons scattered by a sample are lost in a limited-efficiency imaging system. Furthermore, the reconstructed complex image contains quantitative density information, most directly accessible through its phase, which is proportional to the projected electron density of the sample. If applied in three dimensions, CDI can thus recover the sample's electron density distribution. As the extension to three dimensions is accompanied by a considerable dose applied to the sample, cryogenic cooling is necessary to optimize the structural preservation of a unique sample in the beam. This, however, imposes considerable technical challenges on the experimental realization. Here, we show a route toward the solution of these challenges using ptychographic CDI (PCDI), a scanning variant of coherent imaging.

At 100 ng/mL EGF the EGFR forms clusters, which are subsequently internalized, whereas outside the clusters diffusivity increases and the organization of the receptor remains unchanged.

Here, we use electron cryo-microscopy to measure how the hemagglutinin lateral density in the viral envelope changes with cholesterol extraction. We extract this information by measuring the radial distribution function of electron density in >4000 viral images per sample, assigning hemagglutinin density by comparing images with and without anti-HA Fab bound. On average, hemagglutinin trimers move closer together: we estimate that the typical trimer-trimer spacing reduces from 94 to 84\xa0\xc5 when \u223c90% of cholesterol is removed from the viral membrane. Upon restoration of viral envelope cholesterol, this spacing once again expands. This finding can qualitatively explain the observed changes to fusion kinetics: contemporary models from single-virus microscopy are that fusion requires the engagement of several hemagglutinin trimers in close proximity.

The formation of gel phases was determined from the lifetime analysis of trans-parinaric acid. Using calorimetry, we also determined gel phase formation by PSM and DPPC in unsaturated PC mixed bilayers. Comparing PSM with DPPC, we observed that PSM formed a gel phase with less order than DPPC at comparable bilayer concentrations. The same was true when SSM was compared with PSPC. Furthermore, we observed that at equal saturated phospholipid concentration, the gel phases formed were less ordered in unsaturated PCs having 16:0 in sn-1, as compared to PCs having unsaturated acyl chains in both sn-1 and sn-2. The gel phases formed by the saturated phospholipids in unsaturated PC bilayers did not appear to achieve properties similar to pure saturated phospholipid bilayers, suggesting that complete lateral phase separation did not occur. Based on scanning calorimetry analysis, the melting of the gel phases formed by PSM and DPPC in unsaturated PC mixed bilayers (at 45 mol % saturated phospholipid) had low cooperativity and hence most likely were of mixed composition, in good agreement with trans-parinaric acid lifetime data. We conclude that both interfacial properties of the saturated phospholipids and their chain length, as well as the presence of 16:0 in sn-1 of the unsaturated PCs and the total number of cis unsaturations and acyl chain length (18 to 22) of the unsaturated PCs, all affected the formation of gel phases enriched in saturated phospholipids, under the conditions used.']",Miscibility of Sphingomyelins and Phosphatidylcholines in Unsaturated Phosphatidylcholine Bilayers.,3,J Peter Slotte,Anders Kullberg,"[Anders Kullberg, Oscar Oz Ekholm, J Peter Slotte]","[Biochemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland, Electronic address:]"

To study the lipid-composition dependence of photocycle kinetics of bacteriorhodopsin (bR), transient absorption spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the evolution of the photocycle intermediates of bR reconstituted in nanodiscs composed of different ratios of the zwitterionic lipid (DMPC, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine; DOPC, dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine) to the negatively charged lipid (DOPG, dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol; DMPG, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol). The characterization of ion-exchange chromatography showed that the negative surface charge of nanodiscs increased as the content of DOPG or DMPG was increased. The steady-state absorption contours of the light-adapted monomeric bR in nanodiscs composed of different lipid ratios exhibited highly similar absorption features of the retinal moiety at 560 nm, referring to the conservation of the tertiary structure of bR in nanodiscs of different lipid compositions. In addition, transient absorption contours showed that the photocycle kinetics of bR was significantly retarded and the transient populations of intermediates N and O were decreased as the content of DMPG or DOPG was reduced. This observation could be attributed to the negatively charged lipid heads of DMPG and DOPG, exhibiting similar proton relay capability as the native phosphatidylglycerol (PG) analog lipids in the purple membrane. In this work, we not only demonstrated the usefulness of nanodiscs as a membrane-mimicking system, but also showed that the surrounding lipids play a crucial role in altering the biological functions, e.g., the ion translocation kinetics of the transmembrane proteins.']",Tuning the Photocycle Kinetics of Bacteriorhodopsin in Lipid Nanodiscs.,6,Tsyr-Yan Yu,Tsung-Yen Lee,"[Tsung-Yen Lee, Vivien Yeh, Julia Chuang, Jerry Chun Chung Chan, Li-Kang Chu, Tsyr-Yan Yu]","[Department of Chemistry, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Electronic address:]"

Under low light illumination or low ambient temperature conditions, most of the LH2 complexes in the photosynthetic membranes form a B820 exciton with reduced spectral overlap with LH1. To elucidate the reason for this light and temperature adaptation of the LH2 electronic structure, we performed broadband femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a function of excitation wavelength in A.\xa0vinosum membranes. A target analysis of the acquired data yielded individual rate constants for all relevant elementary energy transfer (ET) processes. We found that the ET dynamics in high-light-grown membranes was well described by a homogeneous model, with forward and backward rate constants independent of the pump wavelength. Thus, the overall B800\u2192B850\u2192B890\u2192 Reaction Center ET cascade is well described by simple triexponential kinetics. In the low-light-grown membranes, we found that the elementary backward transfer rate constant from B890 to B820 was strongly reduced compared with the corresponding constant from B890 to B850 in high-light-grown samples. The ET dynamics of low-light-grown membranes was strongly dependent on the pump wavelength, clearly showing that the excitation memory is not lost throughout the exciton lifetime. The observed pump energy dependence of the forward and backward ET rate constants suggests exciton diffusion via B850\u2192 B850 transfer steps, making the overall ET dynamics nonexponential.

Lipid peroxidation is connected to increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, but there is also a required role for mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt-c). In apoptotic mitochondria, cyt-c gains a new function as a lipid peroxidase that catalyzes the reactive oxygen species-mediated chemical modification of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (CL). This peroxidase activity is caused by a conformational change in the protein, resulting from interactions between cyt-c and CL. The nature of the conformational change and how it causes this gain-of-function remain uncertain. Via a combination of functional, structural, and biophysical experiments we investigate the structure and peroxidase activity of cyt-c in its membrane-bound state. We reconstituted cyt-c with CL-containing lipid vesicles, and determined the increase in peroxidase activity resulting from membrane binding. We combined these assays of CL-induced proapoptotic activity with structural and dynamic studies of the membrane-bound protein via solid-state NMR and optical spectroscopy. Multidimensional magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR of uniformly (13)C,(15)N-labeled protein was used to detect site-specific conformational changes in oxidized and reduced horse heart cyt-c bound to CL-containing lipid bilayers. MAS NMR and Fourier transform infrared measurements show that the peripherally membrane-bound cyt-c experiences significant dynamics, but also retains most or all of its secondary structure. Moreover, in two-dimensional and three-dimensional MAS NMR spectra the CL-bound cyt-c displays a spectral resolution, and thus structural homogeneity, that is inconsistent with extensive membrane-induced unfolding. Cyt-c is found to interact primarily with the membrane interface, without significantly disrupting the lipid bilayer. Thus, membrane binding results in cyt-c gaining the increased peroxidase activity that represents its pivotal proapoptotic function, but we do not observe evidence for large-scale unfolding or penetration into the membrane core.']",Structural Changes and Proapoptotic Peroxidase Activity of Cardiolipin-Bound Mitochondrial Cytochrome c.,7,Patrick C A van der Wel,Abhishek Mandal,"[Abhishek Mandal, Cody L Hoop, Maria DeLucia, Ravindra Kodali, Valerian E Kagan, Jinwoo Ahn, Patrick C A van der Wel]","[Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Departments of Environmental and Occupational Health, Chemistry, Pharmacology, and Chemical Biology and Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Electronic address:]"

Here, we performed experiments with highly curved vesicles brought into contact using low concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to investigate the influence of the synaptobrevin (SB) TMD with an attached JMR (SB-JMR-TMD) on the rates of stalk and pore formation during vesicle fusion. SB-JMR-TMD enhanced the rates of stalk and fusion pore (FP) formation in a sharply sigmoidal fashion. We observed an optimal influence at an average of three peptides per vesicle, but only with phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing vesicles. Approximately three SB-JMR-TMDs per vesicle optimally ordered the bilayer interior and excluded water in a similar sigmoidal fashion.

Past studies using biochemical approaches have revealed minor kinetic differences between isozymes formed by different \u03b1-\u03b2 isoform combinations; these results make it difficult to understand the physiological requirement for multiple isoforms. In intact cells, however, NKA enzymes operate in a more complex environment, which includes a substantial transmembrane potential. We evaluated the voltage dependence of human cardiac NKA isozymes expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and of native NKA isozymes in rat ventricular myocytes, using normal mammalian physiological concentrations of Na(+)o and K(+)o.

Our observations provide a simple explanation for the physiological relevance of the \u03b12 subunit (\u223c20% of total \u03b1 subunits in rat ventricle): they act as a reserve and are recruited into action for extra pumping during the long-lasting cardiac action potential, where most of the Na(+) entry occurs. This strong voltage dependence of \u03b12 pumps also helps explain how cardiotonic steroids, which block NKA pumps, can be a beneficial treatment for heart failure: by only inhibiting the \u03b12 pumps, they selectively reduce NKA activity during the cardiac action potential, leading to an increase in systolic Ca(2+), due to reduced extrusion through the Na/Ca exchanger, without affecting resting Na(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations.""]",Importance of the Voltage Dependence of Cardiac Na/K ATPase Isozymes.,6,Pablo Artigas,Christopher M Stanley,"[Christopher M Stanley, Dominique G Gagnon, Adam Bernal, Dylan J Meyer, Joshua J Rosenthal, Pablo Artigas]","[Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Membrane Protein Research, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Membrane Protein Research, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas; Department of Physics, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Ciencias Médicas, Instituto de Neurobiología, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Electronic address:]"

This gradient drives a center-to-surface flow of intracellular fluid. In lenses in which gap-junction coupling is increased, the central pressure is lower, whereas if gap-junction coupling is reduced, the central pressure is higher but surface pressure is always zero. Recently, we found that surface cell pressure was elevated in PTEN null lenses. This suggested disruption of a feedback control system that normally maintained zero surface cell pressure. Our purpose in this study was to investigate and characterize this feedback control system. We measured intracellular hydrostatic pressures in mouse lenses using a microelectrode/manometer-based system. We found that all feedback went through transport by the Na/K ATPase, which adjusted surface cell osmolarity such that pressure was maintained at zero. We traced the regulation of Na/K ATPase activity back to either TRPV4, which sensed positive pressure and stimulated activity, or TRPV1, which sensed negative pressure and inhibited activity. The inhibitory effect of TRPV1 on Na/K pumps was shown to signal through activation of the PI3K/AKT axis. The stimulatory effect of TRPV4 was shown in previous studies to go through a different signal transduction path. Thus, there is a local two-legged feedback control system for pressure in lens surface cells. The surface pressure provides a pedestal on which the pressure gradient sits, so surface pressure determines the absolute value of pressure at each radial location. We speculate that the absolute value of intracellular pressure may set the radial gradient in the refractive index, which is essential for visual acuity.']",Feedback Regulation of Intracellular Hydrostatic Pressure in Surface Cells of the Lens.,5,Richard T Mathias,Junyuan Gao,"[Junyuan Gao, Xiurong Sun, Thomas W White, Nicholas A Delamere, Richard T Mathias]","[Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, Electronic address:]"

The simulations reveal how contraction scales with mechanochemical parameters. For example, they show that the ring made of longer filaments generates greater force but contracts slower. The model predicts that the ring contracts with a constant rate proportional to the initial ring radius if either myosin is released from the ring during contraction and actin filaments shorten, or if myosin is retained in the ring, while the actin filament number decreases. We demonstrate that a balance of actin nucleation and compression-dependent disassembly can also sustain contraction.

We show that there are three regimes for FA evolution depending on their size. Specifically, nascent adhesions with initial lengths below a critical value that are yet to engage in actin fibers will dissolve, whereas bigger ones will grow into mature FAs with a steady state size. In adhesions where growth surpasses the steady state size, disassembly will occur until their sizes are reduced to the equilibrium state. This finding arises from the fact that polymerization of adhesion proteins is force-dependent. Under actomyosin contraction, individual integrin bonds within small FAs (i.e., nascent adhesions or focal complexes) must transmit higher loads while the phenomenon of stress concentration occurs at the edge of large adhesion patches. As such, an effective stiffness of the FA-extracellular matrix complex that is either too small or too large will be relatively low, resulting in a limited actomyosin pulling force developed at the edge that is insufficient to prevent disassembly. Furthermore, it is found that a stiffer extracellular matrix and/or nucleus, as well as a stronger chemomechanical feedback, will induce larger adhesions along with a higher level of contraction force. Interestingly, switching the extracellular side from an elastic half-space, corresponding to some widely used in vitro gel substrates, to a one-dimensional fiber (as in the case of cells anchoring to a fibrous scaffold in vivo) does not qualitative change these conclusions. Our model predictions are in good agreement with a variety of experimental observations obtained in this study as well as those reported in the literature.

Detergents and membrane mimetics can solubilize membrane proteins but do not always result in proper folding and functionality. Here, we use cell-free protein synthesis in the presence of oil drops to create a one-pot system for the synthesis, assembly, and display of functional ssMPs. Our studies suggest that oil drops prevent aggregation of some in vitro-synthesized ssMPs by allowing these ssMPs to localize on oil surfaces. We speculate that oil drops may provide a hydrophobic interior for cotranslational insertion of the transmembrane helices and a fluidic surface for proper assembly and display of the ectodomains. These functionalized oil drop surfaces could mimic cell surfaces and allow ssMPs to interact with cell surface receptors under an environment closest to cell-cell communication. Using this approach, we showed that apoptosis-inducing human transmembrane proteins, FasL and TRAIL, synthesized and displayed on oil drops induce apoptosis of cultured tumor cells. In addition, we take advantage of hydrophobic interactions of transmembrane helices to manipulate the assembly of ssMPs and create artificial clusters on oil drop surfaces. Thus, by coupling protein synthesis with self-assembly at the water-oil interface, we create a platform that can use recombinant ssMPs to communicate with cells.']","One-pot system for synthesis, assembly, and display of functional single-span membrane proteins on oil-water interfaces.",9,David A Weitz,Peter J Yunker,"[Peter J Yunker, Haruichi Asahara, Kuo-Chan Hung, Corey Landry, Laura R Arriaga, Ilke Akartuna, John Heyman, Shaorong Chong, David A Weitz]","[School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332; School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;, Research Department, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA 01938;, Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;, Research Department, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA 01938;  chong@neb, com, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;  chong@neb]"

Using BBS gene knockouts and a mouse infection model, we show the T. brucei BBSome is dispensable for flagellar assembly, motility, bulk endocytosis, and cell viability but required for parasite virulence. Quantitative proteomics reveal alterations in the parasite surface proteome of BBSome mutants, suggesting that virulence defects are caused by failure to maintain fidelity of the host-parasite interface. Interestingly, among proteins altered are those with ubiquitination-dependent localization, and we find that the BBSome interacts with ubiquitin.

During high-frequency stimulation, the synapse undergoes short-term depression and reaches steady-state levels of transmission that sustain the swimming behavior. To determine the release parameters underlying this steady state, we applied variance analysis. Our analysis revealed two functionally distinct subclasses of release sites differing by over 60-fold in rates of vesicle reloading. A slow reloading class requires seconds to recover and contributes to depression onset but not the steady-state transmission.

A combination of diffusiophoresis and Brownian motion leads to a strong size-dependent focusing effect such that the larger particles tend to concentrate more and reside deeper in the channel.

The efficiency of repair, measured by cell viability or competition between each donor and a reference site, showed a strong correlation (r = 0.85 and 0.79) with the contact frequencies of each donor with the DSB repair site. Repair efficiency depends on the distance between donor and recipient rather than any intrinsic limitation of a particular donor site. These results further demonstrate that the search for homology is the rate-limiting step in DSB repair and suggest that cells often fail to repair a DSB because they cannot locate a donor before other, apparently lethal, processes arise. The repair efficiency of a donor locus can be improved by four factors: slower 5' to 3' resection of the DSB ends, increased abundance of replication protein factor A (RPA), longer shared homology, or presence of a recombination enhancer element adjacent to a donor.""]",Chromosome position determines the success of double-strand break repair.,6,James E Haber,Cheng-Sheng Lee,"[Cheng-Sheng Lee, Ruoxi W Wang, Hsiao-Han Chang, Daniel Capurso, Mark R Segal, James E Haber]","[Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454-9110; Rosenstiel Center, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454-9110;, Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T, H, Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115;, Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94107;, Center for Bioinformatics and Molecular Biostatistics, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143]"

Using phylogenetic, structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics techniques, we show that the ancestral DBD from which GR and its paralogs evolved was capable of binding both nGRE and (+)GRE sequences because of the ancestral DBD's ability to assume multiple DNA-bound conformations. Subsequent amino acid substitutions in duplicated daughter genes selectively restricted protein conformational space, causing this dual DNA-binding specificity to be selectively enhanced in the GR lineage and lost in all others.

Although studies have shown support for this theory in nocturnal geckos, the origins of all-cone retinas, such as those found in diurnal colubrid snakes, remain a mystery.

Several intriguing features of garter snake rhodopsin are suggestive of a more cone-like function. We propose that these cone-like rods may have evolved to regain spectral sensitivity and chromatic discrimination as a result of ancestral losses of middle-wavelength cone opsins in early snake evolution.

Current evolutionary theory considers such maternal effect senescence as part of a unified process of reproductive senescence, which is under identical age-specific selective pressures to fertility. We offer a novel theoretical perspective by combining William Hamilton's evolutionary model for aging with a quantitative genetic model of indirect genetic effects. We demonstrate that fertility and maternal effect senescence are likely to experience different patterns of age-specific selection and thus can evolve to take divergent forms. Applied to neonatal survival, we find that selection for maternal effects is the product of age-specific fertility and Hamilton's age-specific force of selection for fertility. Population genetic models show that senescence for these maternal effects can evolve in the absence of reproductive or actuarial senescence; this implies that maternal effect aging is a fundamentally distinct demographic manifestation of the evolution of aging. However, brief periods of increasingly beneficial maternal effects can evolve when fertility increases with age faster than cumulative survival declines. This is most likely to occur early in life. Our integration of theory provides a general framework with which to model, measure, and compare the evolutionary determinants of the social manifestations of aging.

The actin cytoskeleton shows proximity to vacuoles, and the phytohormone auxin not only controls the organization of actin filaments but also impacts vacuolar morphogenesis in an actin-dependent manner. Pharmacological and genetic interference with the actin-myosin system abolishes the effect of auxin on vacuoles and thus disrupts its negative influence on cellular growth. SEM-based 3D nanometer-resolution imaging of the vacuoles revealed that auxin controls the constriction and luminal size of the vacuole.

Here, using mouse intestinal cells and human Caco-2 cells, we show that the microtubule minus-end binding protein CAMSAP3 (calmodulin-regulated-spectrin-associated protein 3) plays a pivotal role in orienting the apical-to-basal polarity of microtubules in epithelial cells.

Camsap3 mutation or depletion resulted in a random orientation of these microtubules; concomitantly, the stereotypic positioning of the nucleus and Golgi apparatus was perturbed. In contrast, the integrity of the plasma membrane was hardly affected, although its structural stability was decreased. Further analysis revealed that the CC1 domain of CAMSAP3 is crucial for its apical localization, and that forced mislocalization of CAMSAP3 disturbs the epithelial architecture.

We address this issue by using the first whole genome data from prehistoric Irish individuals. A Neolithic woman (3343-3020 cal BC) from a megalithic burial (10.3\xd7 coverage) possessed a genome of predominantly Near Eastern origin.

This turnover invites the possibility of accompanying introduction of Indo-European, perhaps early Celtic, language. Irish Bronze Age haplotypic similarity is strongest within modern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh populations, and several important genetic variants that today show maximal or very high frequencies in Ireland appear at this horizon.

Among the latter are the chemical reactions referred to as nonenzymatic posttranslational modifications (NEPTMs), such as glycoxidation, which are responsible for protein molecular aging. Carbamylation is a more recently described NEPTM that is caused by the nonenzymatic binding of isocyanate derived from urea dissociation or myeloperoxidase-mediated catabolism of thiocyanate to free amino groups of proteins. This modification is considered an adverse reaction, because it induces alterations of protein and cell properties. It has been shown that carbamylated proteins increase in plasma and tissues during chronic kidney disease and are associated with deleterious clinical outcomes, but nothing is known to date about tissue protein carbamylation during aging. To address this issue, we evaluated homocitrulline rate, the most characteristic carbamylation-derived product (CDP), over time in skin of mammalian species with different life expectancies. Our results show that carbamylation occurs throughout the whole lifespan and leads to tissue accumulation of carbamylated proteins. Because of their remarkably long half-life, matrix proteins, like type I collagen and elastin, are preferential targets. Interestingly, the accumulation rate of CDPs is inversely correlated with longevity, suggesting the occurrence of still unidentified protective mechanisms. In addition, homocitrulline accumulates more intensely than carboxymethyl-lysine, one of the major advanced glycation end products, suggesting the prominent role of carbamylation over glycoxidation reactions in age-related tissue alterations.

Constitutive COX-2 expression is therapeutically important because NSAIDs cause cardiovascular and renal side effects in otherwise healthy individuals. These side effects are now of major concern globally. However, the pathways driving constitutive COX-2 expression remain poorly understood. Here we show that in the kidney and other sites, constitutive COX-2 expression is a sterile response, independent of commensal microorganisms and not associated with activity of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Instead, COX-2 expression in the kidney but not other regions colocalized with nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor activity and was sensitive to inhibition of calcineurin-dependent NFAT activation. However, calcineurin/NFAT regulation did not contribute to constitutive expression elsewhere or to inflammatory COX-2 induction at any site.

Here we describe WigK/WigR, a histidine kinase/response regulator pair that enables Vibrio cholerae, the cholera pathogen, to survive exposure to antibiotics targeting cell wall synthesis in vitro and during infection. Unlike wild-type V. cholerae, mutants lacking wigR fail to recover following exposure to cell-wall-acting antibiotics, and they exhibit a drastically increased cell diameter in the absence of such antibiotics. Conversely, overexpression of wigR leads to cell slimming. Overexpression of activated WigR also results in increased expression of the full set of cell wall synthesis genes and to elevated cell wall content. WigKR-dependent expression of cell wall synthesis genes is induced by various cell-wall-acting antibiotics as well as by overexpression of an endogenous cell wall hydrolase.

In many pathogens, the transition from a planktonic lifestyle to collaborative, sessile biofilms represents a regulated process orchestrated by the intracellular second-messenger c-di-GMP. A main effector for c-di-GMP signaling in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the transcription regulator FleQ. FleQ is a bacterial enhancer-binding protein (bEBP) with a central AAA+ ATPase \u03c3(54)-interaction domain, flanked by a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a divergent N-terminal receiver domain. Together with a second ATPase, FleN, FleQ regulates the expression of flagellar and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes in response to cellular c-di-GMP. Here we report structural and functional data that reveal an unexpected mode of c-di-GMP recognition that is associated with major conformational rearrangements in FleQ. Crystal structures of FleQ's AAA+ ATPase domain in its apo-state or bound to ADP or ATP-\u03b3-S show conformations reminiscent of the activated ring-shaped assemblies of other bEBPs. As revealed by the structure of c-di-GMP-complexed FleQ, the second messenger interacts with the AAA+ ATPase domain at a site distinct from the ATP binding pocket. c-di-GMP interaction leads to active site obstruction, hexameric ring destabilization, and discrete quaternary structure transitions. Solution and cell-based studies confirm coupling of the ATPase active site and c-di-GMP binding, as well as the functional significance of crystallographic interprotomer interfaces.

In contrast, these mechanisms remain elusive for GC-induced evolutionary conserved inverted repeated negative GC response element (IR nGRE)-mediated direct transrepression and for tethered indirect transrepression that is mediated by DNA-bound NF-\u03baB/activator protein 1 (AP1)/STAT3 activators and instrumental in GC-induced anti-inflammatory activity.

Each RNA contains all of the genetic information for viral replication. Packaging a dimeric genome allows the recovery of genetic information from damaged RNA genomes during DNA synthesis and promotes frequent recombination to increase diversity in the viral population. Therefore, the strategy of packaging dimeric RNA affects viral replication and viral evolution. Although its biological importance is appreciated, very little is known about the genome dimerization process. HIV-1 RNA genomes dimerize before packaging into virions, and RNA interacts with the viral structural protein Gag in the cytoplasm. Thus, it is often hypothesized that RNAs dimerize in the cytoplasm and the RNA-Gag complex is transported to the plasma membrane for virus assembly. In this report, we tagged HIV-1 RNAs with fluorescent proteins, via interactions of RNA-binding proteins and motifs in the RNA genomes, and studied their behavior at the plasma membrane by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We showed that HIV-1 RNAs dimerize not in the cytoplasm but on the plasma membrane. Dynamic interactions occur among HIV-1 RNAs, and stabilization of the RNA dimer requires Gag protein. Dimerization often occurs at an early stage of the virus assembly process. Furthermore, the dimerization process is probably mediated by the interactions of two RNA-Gag complexes, rather than two RNAs.

The benefit of this defense strategy has led to the rapid spread of Spiroplasma throughout the range of D. neotestacea, although the molecular basis for this protection has been unresolved.

Additionally, we found that truncating the long cytoplasmic tail of Env restores incorporation of Env into MA trimer-defective particles, thus rescuing infectivity. We therefore propose a model whereby MA trimerization is required to form a lattice capable of accommodating the long cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env; in the absence of MA trimerization, Env is sterically excluded from the assembling particle.

Until now, this disease has been consistently associated with a single aneuploid cancer cell lineage that we refer to as DFT1. Here we describe a second transmissible cancer, DFT2, in five devils located in southern Tasmania in 2014 and 2015. DFT2 causes facial tumors that are grossly indistinguishable but histologically distinct from those caused by DFT1. DFT2 bears no detectable cytogenetic similarity to DFT1 and carries a Y chromosome, which contrasts with the female origin of DFT1. DFT2 shows different alleles to both its hosts and DFT1 at microsatellite, structural variant, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci, confirming that it is a second cancer that can be transmitted between devils as an allogeneic, MHC-discordant graft.

A unique fluorogen activation mechanism based on two spectroscopic changes, increase of fluorescence quantum yield and absorption red shift, provides high labeling selectivity. Y-FAST was engineered from the 14-kDa photoactive yellow protein by directed evolution using yeast display and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Y-FAST is as bright as common fluorescent proteins, exhibits good photostability, and allows the efficient labeling of proteins in various organelles and hosts. Upon fluorogen binding, fluorescence appears instantaneously, allowing monitoring of rapid processes in near real time. Y-FAST distinguishes itself from other tagging systems because the fluorogen binding is highly dynamic and fully reversible, which enables rapid labeling and unlabeling of proteins by addition and withdrawal of the fluorogen, opening new exciting prospects for the development of multiplexing imaging protocols based on sequential labeling.']",Small fluorescence-activating and absorption-shifting tag for tunable protein imaging in vivo.,20,Arnaud Gautier,Marie-Aude Plamont,"[Marie-Aude Plamont, Emmanuelle Billon-Denis, Sylvie Maurin, Carole Gauron, Frederico M Pimenta, Christian G Specht, Jian Shi, Jérôme Quérard, Buyan Pan, Julien Rossignol, Karine Moncoq, Nelly Morellet, Michel Volovitch, Ewen Lescop, Yong Chen, Antoine Triller, Sophie Vriz, Thomas Le Saux, Ludovic Jullien, Arnaud Gautier]","[Department of Chemistry, École Normale Supérieure, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, F-75005 Paris, France; Sorbonne Universités, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, UMR 8640 PASTEUR, F-75005 Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 8640 PASTEUR, F-75005 Paris, France;, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology, CNRS UMR 7241, INSERM U1050, Labex MemoLife, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University/Collège de France, F-75005 Paris, France;, École Normale Supérieure, Institut de Biologie de l'École Normale Supérieure (IBENS), CNRS UMR 8197, INSERM U1024, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, F-75005 Paris, France;, Laboratoire de Biologie Physico-Chimique des Protéines Membranaires, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, CNRS UMR 7099, Université Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, F-75005 Paris, France, Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, CNRS UPR 2301, Université Paris-Saclay, 91198 Gif-sur-Yvette, France;, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology, CNRS UMR 7241, INSERM U1050, Labex MemoLife, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University/Collège de France, F-75005 Paris, France; École Normale Supérieure, Institut de Biologie de l'École Normale Supérieure (IBENS), CNRS UMR 8197, INSERM U1024, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, F-75005 Paris, France;, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology, CNRS UMR 7241, INSERM U1050, Labex MemoLife, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University/Collège de France, F-75005 Paris, France; Université Paris Diderot Sorbonne Paris Cité, 75205 Paris, France, Department of Chemistry, École Normale Supérieure, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, F-75005 Paris, France; Sorbonne Universités, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, UMR 8640 PASTEUR, F-75005 Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 8640 PASTEUR, F-75005 Paris, France;  ludovic, jullien@ens, fr]"

Combining remote-sensing and ground-based observations with a size- and age-structured terrestrial ecosystem model, we explore the sensitivity and ecological resilience of these forests to changes in climate. We demonstrate that water stress operating at the scale of individual plants, combined with spatial variation in soil texture, explains observed patterns of variation in ecosystem biomass, composition, and dynamics across the region, and strongly influences the ecosystem's resilience to changes in dry season length. Specifically, our analysis suggests that in contrast to existing predictions of either stability or catastrophic biomass loss, the Amazon forest's response to a drying regional climate is likely to be an immediate, graded, heterogeneous transition from high-biomass moist forests to transitional dry forests and woody savannah-like states.

Investigation of this mechanism unexpectedly showed that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy changes at FLC did not reflect RNA fold changes. Mathematical modeling of these transcriptional dynamics predicted a tight coordination of transcriptional initiation and elongation. This prediction was validated by detailed measurements of total and chromatin-bound FLC intronic RNA, a methodology appropriate for analyzing elongation rate changes in a range of organisms. Transcription initiation was found to vary \u223c 25-fold with elongation rate varying \u223c 8- to 12-fold. Premature sense transcript termination contributed very little to expression differences. This quantitative variation in transcription was coincident with variation in H3K36me3 and H3K4me2 over the FLC gene body.

However, the relative importance of each of these effects on genome-wide patterns of deleterious variation remains controversial. Domestic and wild canids offer a powerful system to address the role of these factors in influencing deleterious variation because their history is dominated by known bottlenecks and intense artificial selection. Here, we assess genome-wide patterns of deleterious variation in 90 whole-genome sequences from breed dogs, village dogs, and gray wolves. We find that the ratio of amino acid changing heterozygosity to silent heterozygosity is higher in dogs than in wolves and, on average, dogs have 2-3% higher genetic load than gray wolves. Multiple lines of evidence indicate this pattern is driven by less efficient natural selection due to bottlenecks associated with domestication and breed formation, rather than recent inbreeding. Further, we find regions of the genome implicated in selective sweeps are enriched for amino acid changing variants and Mendelian disease genes. To our knowledge, these results provide the first quantitative estimates of the increased burden of deleterious variants directly associated with domestication and have important implications for selective breeding programs and the conservation of rare and endangered species. Specifically, they highlight the costs associated with selective breeding and question the practice favoring the breeding of individuals that best fit breed standards.

These results highlight the therapeutic potential of cyclin D1 therapy in MCL and present a novel RNAi delivery system that opens new therapeutic opportunities for treating MCL and other B-cell malignancies.']",Harnessing RNAi-based nanomedicines for therapeutic gene silencing in B-cell malignancies.,14,Dan Peer,Shiri Weinstein,"[Shiri Weinstein, Itai A Toker, Rafi Emmanuel, Srinivas Ramishetti, Inbal Hazan-Halevy, Daniel Rosenblum, Meir Goldsmith, Avigdor Abraham, Ohad Benjamini, Osnat Bairey, Pia Raanani, Arnon Nagler, Judy Lieberman, Dan Peer]","[Laboratory of NanoMedicine, Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S, Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the Iby and Aladar Fleischman Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel; Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel;, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer 5262100, Israel;, Institute of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel;, Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115]"
